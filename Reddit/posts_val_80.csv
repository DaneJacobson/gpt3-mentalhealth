8cfcfd73-a313-490b-909c-67a54de2e9f8,"the recent discussion about posts from people who've just started meds made me realize that it has been a year since i made my own [""i just started meds!!"" the last year has been quite a journey finding a med that worked well for me, but now that i have, it has definitely changed my life for the better. here is some of what i have learned from the experience: *finding the right med* * **don't assume what works best for other people will work best for you.** from reading here, i had gotten the impression that adderall was more effective than ritalin, and either was more effective than strattera. but once i started taking them, the opposite turned out to be true: strattera was very effective (but gave me bad side effects), ritalin also worked well (it's what i'm still on now), and i *hated* adderall (made me feel not-myself, somehow angry and emotionless at the same time). * **allow yourself time to acclimate to the meds before judging how they work.** the first time i took ritalin it was horrible, like my brain was a car trying to drive with the parking brake stuck on. by the third or forth time i took it, my reaction to it changed, and it started to be more helpful. * **what extended release format you have matters.** concerta and ritalin la have exactly the same active ingredient, they only differ in the release system. but the release system can make a huge difference in how fast the drug enters your system, and what dose you get throughout the day. for me concerta was ineffective in the morning (too low) and made me feel really stressed out in the afternoon (too much), but ritalin la felt like a good even dose throughout the day. * **too high of a dose can be as bad as too low.** on too high of a dose, i feel stressed out and overwhelmed - that stress reaction makes my focus and procrastination worse instead of better. *things that affect how your meds work* * **if you've just stopped taking something else, be aware that that may be affecting you too.** my psychiatrist told me to quit caffeine before starting meds, and dealing with caffeine withdrawal symptoms made my meds seem less effective at first. the same thing can apply when switching classes of meds - med b may not work so well for you while your brain is still adjusting to being off of med a. * **if you have other mental health problems, they need to be treated too.** my adhd meds are much more effective when my antidepressants are working well. sometimes it seems like my wellbutrin and my ritalin are working together to pick me up off the couch -- ""ok, you take her feet, i'll get her shoulders..."" * **sleep, mood, and exercise can all affect your meds. if you do not sleep enough, your meds are way less effective.** other things like being in a bad mood can also affect how well your meds work. and i've found that if i exercise intensely one day, my meds are more effective the following day. * **if you are female, your hormones can affect your meds.** i found meds did almost nothing during the luteal phase of my monthly cycle. getting on birth control pills helped even that out for me and make them effective all month long (but ymmv, some people find birth control pills make their meds less effective instead of helping). *what to expect from meds* * **meds can be subtle, you may not ""feel"" them.** when i take ritalin, i don't feel like i'm on something, i just feel like my normal self - but when i try to do something, it's easier to make myself do it and i'm less likely to get distracted or overwhelmed. * **if you have other mental health problems, treating the adhd may help with them.** having my adhd properly medicated has definitely reduced my depression and anxiety. * **meds will not turn you into someone that you're not.** if you don't like chess, then taking meds and sitting down at a chess board is not going to give you the motivation and focus to become a chess grandmaster. * **your achievements on meds are yours -- meds may have reduced the obstacles, but you are still the one who made it happen.** if you got an a on your math exam, that's *your* a. lots of other people could have taken the same meds and still not gotten an a. your talent and your effort are what got you the a once the meds reduced some of the obstacles. * **sometimes meds don't help as much as you'd hoped.** they improve my symptoms, but they don't make my symptoms totally go away. there are still things i struggle a lot with. it doesn't mean i don't care about these things - i want to do better on all of them and it upsets me that i don't - but i still have a brain disorder that makes me struggle with these things, and while it can be somewhat improved, it will never be ""fixed"". * **meds make you *able* to improve your life, but you still need behavioral strategies to help them work.** before meds, i had tried many systems for productivity and organization, but they always fell apart. it wasn't until i was medicated that i was able to start sticking to that kind of thing and making it work. and i do really *really* need my behavioral and organizational strategies for managing adhd - if i use my strategies my meds are a tremendous help, if i don't then my meds just make me slightly more alert while i read reddit, watch tv, and procrastinate. one year on, meds are still a huge improvement in my life. ritalin is just as effective for me now as it was the first time i felt it helping. if anything it's more effective, because i have learned how to work with it to optimize how it works in my life, and it has made me able to make some long-term changes like keeping a daily schedule. meds have not fixed everything in my life - my apartment is still a mess, i still procrastinate (although not as much), i still forget to do things, and i still lose my keys multiple times per week. but meds have helped me to improve so many things, to the point that ***i no longer feel like a hopeless fuck-up and i actually feel hope and confidence about the future*** (most of the time, anyway…). when i look back at [where i was i really can say meds really have been an amazing, life-changing difference.",adhd,0

9293bcfd-ff84-44aa-bdce-262bafaf6831,"i was diagnosed in 2nd grade and adhd was described to me as the reason why i couldn’t stop moving and wouldn’t pay attention in class. i have been on and off medication for treating those symptoms for most of my life. some medications allow me to sit still and to focus on things (typically the wrong thing to be focusing on like youtube or video games). all of this time i thought that if the medication made me stop moving and allowed me to focus, then it “relieved” my adhd and my inability to now go and do what i needed to do was my fault, and that i wasn’t disciplined enough, or i was lazy. because i had adhd for so long, i never really looked into literature about it, because i thought i knew what it was and that the symptoms weren’t that bad. i thought to myself, “moving around all the time and jumping from idea to idea isn’t so bad, my real problem is i can’t get the things i need to do done”, which i thought was separate from the adhd. last night, during an extended roaming quest around the internet, i made the impulsive purchase of a book (which i do all the time) on adhd (which i have never done before). in the book (the adult adhd tool kit), it described adhd being a disorder characterized by an impairment of the executive thought system causing a reduction in the ability to motivate yourself to do things that do not result in short term gain. this caused me to go completely nuts, because this describes me perfectly, i am an addict of short term rewards over long term benefits. i, and my parents, and my teachers, always attributed this to some character flaw in myself whereas i accepted my hyperactivity and attention problems as a characteristic of my disorder. this completely changes how i view my actions, as well as my treatment of those i know with adhd, and feels very life changing for me as i can actually seek out treatment options to help the executive system problems rather than the hyperactivity and in attention. i feel stupid for not finding this out sooner and like i was overly proud for so long (i felt i didn’t need to read someone else’s definition of adhd, i “know what it is, i have it”) thanks for reading my rant.",adhd,0

cf0fbd8f-dde9-47d1-a971-50a25b1d7668,"[hi, here's another long tutorial post that talks about some of the strategies i use to manage life with mental illness. there are pictures, too! ---- #why my previous solutions failed me: i've tried using apps, software, and pen and paper, but i don't like them. apps/software have cool features for syncing and organization, but at the end of the day, they still exist in one physical device. it's just a flat piece of glass and electronics, and the **responsibility is still on me to remember to open the app** and access the information. that's exactly what an executive functioning disorder makes difficult. paper is better, because i can take a piece of paper and **stick it somewhere where i'm likely to see it**, even when i do day-to-day things. post-it notes are even better. the problem is, papers are also **easy to misplace, easy to crumple up**, and if you have a lot of thoughts, **hard to keep track of**. they're very cheap and disposable and take a lot of work to actually use correctly. &amp;nbsp; #why whiteboards are better: they give you all the benefits of pen and paper, but get rid of some of the downsides. portable whiteboards are **much more sturdy and re-usable.** when you're done with a thought, or a task, or an appointment, you can just erase it and **continue using the same board**. the only issue is, they're kind of hard to carry around with you without accidentally erasing what you've written, because the board rubs up against stuff in your bag. ---- #my diy project: i wanted a way to bring whiteboards with me, in my bag. these are the supplies i bought: * transparent page protectors with holes for ring binders * some sort of hard material that won't bend, about the size of a sheet of paper. (plastic, wood, whatever) * blank white pieces of paper * duct tape * a binder (preferably one that's hard, not flexible. bonus points if it can fold over on itself flatly.) * literally anything to act as spacers between the pages. (you want to be able to have a gap between whiteboard pages so they don't rub up against each other in your binder) you can probably find a way to do this lying around the house. &amp;nbsp; here's some simple steps to make the portable whiteboard pages i made: 1. put the rigid material in the page protector. 2. use the blank white pages to make the surface look white (placed between the transparent sheet and the rigid material). 3. tape it all up fancy. (you only really need to add tape to seal the pages, but i added more to make it look nicer) 4. add the spacers to the pages so that it makes a gap when they're lying flat. ---- #ways i've used specific pages: **sharpies** + whiteboards are awesome. they'll be mostly permanent (edit: i say ""mostly permanent"" because if you write over permanent marker with dry erase marker, then erase, it'll come right off. so, it allows you to be flexible with your use of markers!), so you can use sharpie to **make templates** by adding titles and creating grids, then write in them with the dry-erase whiteboard markers. **blank pages** are also really good for brainstorming. gets your thoughts from your head to the page without using up a billion pieces of paper. lets you erase mistakes easily. lets you communicate your thoughts more easily when just vocalizing it can be really hard. &amp;nbsp; here are some example templates: &amp;nbsp; [**weekly organizer** -- click for image of finished i work week by week, one section for each day of the week. anything that's not within the next week, i add to an 8th section called future, so it's still there. more efficient than a monthly/yearly calendar for me, because it's easier to fit on a small page. &amp;nbsp; [**task/activity organizer** -- click for image of finished you've probably seen those grids with 4 quadrants, urgent/not urgent, important/not important. it's called the **eisenhower decision matrix** and it did not work for me. i spent so much time trying to figure out if something was ""important"" or ""urgent"" i just stopped trying to use it. instead, i sort my responsibilities by how badly they'll mess up my life if i forget them, and i sort all the cool things in life by their benefit to me. by doing this, you frame things in terms of their rewards and consequences, which is 100% the key to motivation for people with adhd imo. &amp;nbsp; ***responsibilities, obligations and commitments*** * **really important shit:** this is anything that will have a serious impact on my life if i forget to do it. if i ignore these things, then my life will spiral downward and i'll start to panic. this is where i put things related to financial deadlines, or upcoming assignments/tests, or important paperwork i need to do as an adult. * **sorta important shit:** this is stuff that i should probably do, but if i forget it, it won't be the end of the world. it'll probably still suck, but it won't completely ruin my life or anything. normal chores go here. ***rich and fulfilling life categories*** * **useful shit:** this is stuff that i can work on in my free time that'll be useful for my growth as a human being. anything relating to skills and self-betterment goes here. * **fun shit:** this is where i put all of the things i could spend time on that i really enjoy doing, and that make me really happy. &amp;nbsp; when i go to decide how i should spend my time, i refer to my chart and make sure i'm not neglecting anything with **consequences**. if i'm not, then i choose an activity with **benefits**. (edit: of course, i chose to write this post instead of working on the *really important shit*, so i'm gonna go work on those things right now.) ---- that's it. i stick these pages in a binder, carry the binder with me everywhere i go. if i'm at home, i'll prop important pages up in places where i can 100% see them. i stick them in my line of sight, and work through every item one at a time, and erase them when i finish them. everything is easily accessible and easy to see, and nothing gets lost in the depths of an app, or in a stack of pages. because there are literally only 2-4 pages, instead of hundreds. hope this helps! **tl;dr: whiteboards are awesome, i made portable whiteboard pages, then came up with some rad ways to use them to organize my shit.**",adhd,0

""*ohhhh fuck 😰,"" i thought. but i was determined to fight through it. last week i got my first interview for a copywriting job at a digital marketing agency. my first real job interview *ever*. my heart was pounding out of my chest from the minute i woke up to when i arrived at the office. i was absolutely terrified of blushing during the interview, stumbling over my words and the manager noticing i was clearly not a confident or capable candidate. it’s the most nervous i’ve been in a long time. somehow, i managed to get through the interview (which lasted 1 hour and 30 mins!) and make a good impression. a *really* good impression, in fact. the manager called me yesterday and offered me the job! 😁 he liked that i even remembered peoples' names, which i generally make an effort to do, if only to avoid looking like a forgetful clutz. i guess anxiety *can* be a good thing! i start the job next month and i’m already super nervous, but i’m also really proud of myself. a few years ago i would be too anxious to even google “job search” for fear of being taken out of my comfort zone. these last few weeks i've learned that that fear *is* conquerable, these fears are mostly a fabrication of anxiety anyway, and there are far better emotions and feelings to be found beyond that fear. life is too short to live miserably in the shadows. i don’t think i would’ve had the courage to make this change if it wasn’t for a few things: &amp;#x200b; * meditation. i like to use the [calm which has a whole range of emotion-specific sessions and series (calming anxiety, boosting self-esteem etc). the one about confronting difficult emotions was especially helpful on those days i *really* didn’t want to think about job hunting. * mood board. make a photo album of things that make you happy — people, places, possessions, memories, movies etc. i’m most anxious in the morning, so looking through my mood board (while listening to feel-good songs) every morning really helped to lift my mood and confidence to start the day. * make a list. write down things you’ve done in the past that you’re proud of, things you’ve achieved, challenges you’ve overcome, no matter how silly or small. remind yourself that you *can* be confident, you *are* capable, and you *do* have value. * find inspirational people. for me, learning that bill hader (the super funny and seemingly self-assured actor/comedian/director) has struggled with anxiety all his life — to the point where he’d get physically ill in the days leading up to *snl* — but has still been able to find success in life, is totally inspiring, in a weird way. if you do one thing today, watch [this video of him talking about his * [owning it: the anxiety a super insightful, relatable and inspiring podcast on all things anxiety, hosted by irish author caroline foran. i only discovered it a few weeks ago, but it has already given me so much useful information on how to manage and overcome anxiety. thank you to anyone who has read this far. however bad your anxiety may be, there is always hope.",anxiety,1

8fa69fa3-46a0-43a8-93e9-2b3e721794f8,"my life story; so i developed pretty late. from grades 6-11 i was ugly, i had a chubbyish face, wasn't fat but was very untoned, and was very awkward looking. i got bullied a lot back then and i remember i used to hide sometimes in toilets to avoid getting picked on. i only remember how much i was bullied when one of my highschool friends brings it up as a joke when are meeting up. i used to feel inherently uncool, like i could never have good friends, that no chill person would want to be my friend. in about 11th grade my face shed of its fat, my jawline came through, and i became really good looking. i was still bullied in grade 11 because i had become a target almost, people said i was easy to target because it was like after the years of bullying, my balls were gone, i became a bitch, they had bullied my confidence/self esteem right out of me. then i went to college and tried to be a completely different person, tried to get my mental/outlook frame to and on par with the other good looking people. it worked on the odd times and people used to treat me much differently to school. but i could never make moves properly on girls/was kind of awkward and couldn't talk well and confidently with people even tho it was starting to piece togather. i realised these good looking people around me had been like that since they were so young, but for me it was like being born again, i didn't know how to act/do things, i always felt no one really liked me and always felt i was being used in some way or form. i smoked weed and that made me even more paranoid, i used to feel i was ugly and my good looks were an illusion, that everyone was making fun of me and i was worthless. in college i made quite a few friends but ofc never ever spoke about my past. to them i was this good looking guy who seemed to be a bit arrogant even, and quiet, and even not that smart. my looks were there, but the personality was lacking far far behind. how could i make up in 1-2 years for what others spent their entire youth mastering? i read everything i could, how to win friends and influence people etc.. i became better with girls quite a lot but i still am awkward in person a lot of the time, they just dont percieve me as an awkward guy because of how i look. i just come across as someone who is a bit full of himself or something. i've been called an asshole quite a few times for that. sophomore year i became better, i began to realise weed was no good for me, i realised that my friends liked me for who i was, and that the silliness i had from highschool, was still there, i began to study more and showed my intelligent side (i go to a highly ranked university). i began to smile, appreciate others, care to make good friends. the fear of people no liking me based on how i look is going. i am still pretty self conscious which is something i need to erradicate as soon as possible. i'm entering my junior year at college, with set goals. i need to 1) lose my virginity 2) get a beautiful girl as my girlfriend. i've never had a girlfriend, the thought of rejection would have buried me with my low self esteem and extreme boughts of anxiety. the anxiety tells me i am worthless, that i will never get a girlfriend, that such things are not for people like me, its terrible, i can often not sleep and toss and turn a lot. im still very insecure about my looks, i look in the mirror a lot to check if i look half decent. many people think i am a narcissist or something because of it. i wish i could download all the experiences other guys had during highschool, and college, and be able to feel that different mental/frame outlook. it must feel so great to believe so many girls are into you, to have that mental outlook of confidence, to know u can always do and achieve, and get beautiful girlfriends. i know this is impossible, and i will have to have these experiences. wisdom/experience cannot be derived from books, and only experience. i know i must fail a bunch more times with girls quickly before i succeed. the anxiety bouts i have at times are severe. i don't take any medications tho nor do i want to ever. i get depressed and look around my room or wherever i am to things i can use or where i can hang myself. end my poor little life. i have to convince myself i am good looking again, i am worth a lot, its my own mental frame that is fucking me over, crippling me, that i have so many friends who are very cool at university who i could be even better friends with, i could play less games with girls and be open/honest and genuine with them. i just fucked it up with a girl i had a huuuge crush on and that is killing me rn, and has been for the last few days. i feel so shit, the anxiety is ruining me. i have a shredded/muscluar body, i'm a pretty short guy at 5'8 but i've learned that is inconsequential as it is the confidence that comes with height that is so attractive (tho i know height is much sexier). i have a face like a less hot more cute version of zayn malik. but this past month i stopped working out, began smoking a lot when the anxiety trips were high. my diet got shit. i still look the same, i haven't lost any of my gains/look very fit, but i am weaker. i've stopped smoking so much now only like a cigarette a day and i'll get over this girl soon. junior year is where i want to come in strong, use all my wisdom from the last 2 years and realise my potential. to make all the moves i can with girls, be fun, be genuine, accept myself for whatever i am, be happy, smile, show interest in others, and accept that i am a good looking guy, i am very very lucky to look and have the life that i do, and if my mental frame is gonna keep fucking me, its not acceptable. i am still a slave to my anxiety but i am fighting, each day i tell myself don't just don't start the thought cycle where i am useless etc.. sorry for this long essay to those of you who stuck around to read my life story.",anxiety,1

(i mean, then it gets worse, then better, then worse than before, but then better again.) so last year i got hit by a worst episode of depression so far. i dropped out of university, i quit my job (it was shitty anyway), i stopped leaving the house. after a few months i was getting up just once a week to go to therapy and the therapy wasn't helping one bit. by the end of the year i was suicidal. it just seemed like a logical next step. but i am a single parent of a 4-year old malinois and i wanted him taken care of, so i decided to stage an accident. the money from my life insurance would be more than enough to rehome him and keep him well-fed for the rest of his life. so i told my family i'm going camping as usual, waited for the worst snowstorm to hit and then went to the woods. when the temperature dropped to -20 c, in the middle of the night i tucked my dog in and went out to lie down on the snow. but my dog didn't want to stay in the tent by himself. he kept whining, barking, scratching, finally got out and laid down next to me. him surviving was the hole point of this undertaking, so i kept dragging him back into the tent, wrapping him in a sleeping bag and getting back to dying, but he's a stubborn little shit. i didn't die that night. i tried again on the following night with the same outcome. i was too resigned to keep trying. it took all the energy i had to get back home, then go to therapy as usual because i still intended to die accidentally as soon as possible. when my therapist saw me, she called the psychiatrist in and i was put on a massive dose of antidepressants and mood stabilizers immiedately. within few weeks i felt a little better, enough to put off my death until spring. i don't know how i made it to today, but i did. i cleaned myself up. i cleaned the house. i started leaving my bed again. i threw out the 'depression sweatpants'. i got a haircut. i met a boy. i fell in love. i got a great job offer. then i got the job. i moved to the new city. i fixed my diet. i fixed my sleep. i moved in with the boy. i'm here now. and i'm really fucking glad i'm still here. i'm gonna enjoy the shit out of it while it lasts.",bipolar,2

they didn't divorce like you thought they would. but long gone is the comfortable middle class status you grew up with. she blew through all her money. you were right all along - she was trying to take advantage of you. but you shouldn't have cared so much, because just because you're diagnosed with a mental disorder... doesn't mean you'll have to be dependent on the government for the rest of your life. it doesn't mean you can't do this or that. sure some things might be a bit harder for you, but you'll get to do a lot of things most people don't get to do. so what have you done? you've interviewed some famous musicians for your college newspaper. you somehow managed an entire semester in college while you were technically homeless. you've made friends with the local music scene (and lived with) a semi-famous band. fuck, you even had a stint as a commercial fisherman with cousin (spoiler: he's even creepier than you already think.) oh, and you have six tattoos now, including a full sleeve. didn't expect that one, did you? so yeah, lil reaper, i'm writing to you today because this was the *real* day you became an orphan. and so much of your sadness will stem from the fact that no one will love you like that woman did. not your parents. not your sisters. not your extended family. no girl you ever try to date (don't even ask about that...) no one from your hometown. yeah, your hometown, this semi-idyllic 1950s neighborhood of split levels and cape cods, where you could always run a few streets away to her house when things got bad. then grandma's about a mile down the road, where your mother's family carried 60+ years of alcoholism and general dysfunction. so you're leaving all the shit behind. you will spend this day ten years from now throwing away everything in the house as your dad prepares to move into a guest room at the house that belonged to his mother, nearly half an hour from here. and you go... somewhere. yeah homie, you're finally on your own. i'll tell you, though. wherever i (we) go, i still have hope. we're losing everything right now, so you might think i'm delusional. but those external measures of success that you're so obsessed with... those things you thought you had to accomplish to be ""worthwhile""... you'll realize how little they actually matter once they basically disappear. your place in society will completely change. yet you'll find a life that's so much simpler and... happiness will just be so much simpler. and someone will find you, and learn to love you (as you are, not the way they want you to be.) i mean, i still haven't found her yet... but i know we will. much love lil bro, ~reaper o'souls, 11/3/2017 (oh and just so you know, soulja boy ended up being a one-hit wonder. thank fucking god.)",bipolar,2

e5b493e9-4e4f-4ef4-9bcc-778658b8415b,"back story summary: currently unmedicated for bipolar i, with small dosage meds for uncontrollable anxiety and daily meds for adhd. primary caretaker for my elderly mother (that may have dementia on top of her mental issues) that has manipulated her way into keeping me home and doing for her unless i have to work. i have no free time , no time for me, and no time for anything other than serving her, which is what she prefers. there’s a chance that i will have to put her in assisted living which means i’ll have to sell her house, which will leave me homeless. then my bf of five years broke up with me because he “doesn’t have time” for me, but also because he can’t figure out how to bring me into his life without hurting or upsetting family and risking losing their love, so into the trash i went. 4 weeks in and i’m past rock bottom because the future and the life we’d been working towards is gone. everything we built is dead and it killed so much of me with it. he was the only person that ever felt like home to me and now i’m lost and alone. i have no support; no friends, no family, just my boss. of all the people that know that i’m crashing and burning because i’ve reached out for help, he’s the only one that even concerns himself with me. he has been my boss for almost 6 years and i can honestly say he is more like a father to me than my own father ever was. i love that man to the moon and back for everything that he’s ever done for me. a week ago i attempted suicide. i just don’t have the ability to fix myself anymore, and i’m at a point now where i can’t see a reason to try. the harder i work at making a better life the more i lose. i’m so tired of living with the clusterfuck inside of my head and i can’t find anything to make me want to keep going. i got my deceased fathers gun and found the courage to pull the trigger but since i keep it loaded a certain way (that i’d forgotten about), it didn’t go as planned. maybe that was a blessing or maybe not. i don’t really know. it wasn’t just because of the boyfriend but a combination of everything in my life going to shit in a high speed downward spiral. i don’t have the will or the strength to fight this hard all of the time for nothing at all. today was my first visit with my therapist since october. i was barely there five minutes when i completely broke down and told her everything. ugly crying, shaking, hysterical breakdown. we discussed a few options and plan to get me medicated (she and my pcp do that as a team) then came the crisis watch safety form. it’s a list of things that i have to do like check in with her office at random intervals as well as respond to emails or phone calls from her also at random intervals. all of my prescription medication, over-the-counter medication, knives and guns, scissors, razors, or anything that i could harm myself with has to be given to someone preferably in my household so it can be locked up. i have to have supervision if i’m eating a meal that needs to be cut with a knife. no drinking or drugs which is fine because i do neither except my prescription medications, and i also have to give to people emergency contact information for suicide lines as well as the crisis lines for emergency mental help in my area. if my pcp calls me and to bring my prescriptions so that she can count my medications to make sure that i’m not abusing them i have to oblige. i have to keep all of my appointments with my primary care doctor as well as my therapist for exactly one month before this agreement expires. failure to comply with any of these things will allow her to request a temporary detention order for immediate involuntary psychiatric hospitalization for me. she still on the fence about putting me into an inpatient situation right now but she will make that decision when i go back to see her at the end of the week. the messed up part to me is that involuntary hospitalization scares me more than the fact that i tried to kill myself. it upsets me to know how far i’ve fallen from the days where i didn’t need to be medicated for my bipolar because i was able to take care of myself to keep it fairly well controlled. and now i can’t tell the difference between the bipolar and the real me. everything in me still wants to stop existing but i feel like if i could just keep going a little longer maybe it will get better. and then the realization hits me that i have nothing to go forward to nothing that means anything to me to drive me to go forward. i’m so overwhelmed that my ability to process anything logically has just stopped working. the last few weeks everything has been so emotionally charged that my rapid cycling is that an extreme high and i just want it to stop. i don’t even know what i am other than a mental illness because that is all that defines me anymore. i just want to be who i was before everything destroyed me but i don’t think i can find my way back to anything good.",bipolar,2

f307bed5-38b0-4a3a-9056-58bbb4b26831,"*disclaimer: i understand that this post is insanely long but i feel condensing it will dilute its message. some of this is unrelated to my bipolar ii but it still plays a central role in my issue so i felt this would be the best place to post this (plus i don't know where else to post). little new here. i've been suffering from the symptoms of bipolar ii along with social anxiety since my early teens so throughout middle/high school it crippled me socially. my rapid, awkward, all-over-the-place speech in my hypomanic phases and my mumbly, confused speech in depressive phases (if i even spoke at all) along with anxiety kept me from really connecting with anyone and i was never able (and still am not very able) to display my true self, something that crushes/depresses me to this day. it also seriously held me back academically/athletically. i was a straight-a student with a promising competitive swimming career up until around 9th grade when my disorder had grown to an unmanageable level due to it going untreated, and it continued to for the rest of high school, with my relatively strict parents calling it bullshit at every turn and never getting me in any counseling or put on any meds until i dropped out of college at 18. only then did they listen and see an issue. knowing that i never realized my potential in any area of my life sends me flying into bouts of extreme depressive episodes in which i cry over what could have been and it can last days. i only thought i had depression at this point so i was misdiagnosed for another year. now at 20 i am finally diagnosed properly and on a mood stablizier although it hasn't been particulary effective, and smoking weed and dropping acid probably doesn't help matters. but i must admit that my first couple trips allowed me to take inventory and understand that i've been bouncing between manic/depressive phases since childhood and that my issue quite possibly extends into sex addiction/hypersexuality. and it brought certain behaviors and memories to the surface that i wasn't willing to face and it's a big reason why i'm even here posting this (i do not condone the use of lsd, especially for the people on this subreddit). now we get to the main point that the title addresses (not sure if i had to give ya'll my life story first).throughout my adolescent life a common theme has been my complete and utter lack of control of my sexual impulses, resulting in shameful behavior that i keep buried away from many: public masturbation. at the beach with a towel over me, in the nearest public bathroom and even in class. i knew it was disgusting as i was doing it, but simply had to get off constantly like some nympho. i could only dart to the bathroom throughout the day so many times (our monthly hall passes gave us a limited number of times to leave class). after reflecting, i feel that this urge was aggravated by a combination of my hypomanic phases (which involves being too horny) and my hypersexuality, bringing my sex drive to an insane level. if this is the case, then it would explain that behavior. it doesn't justify it, but it gives insight into how this happened. and teachers did nothing to address it. unless the kid's autistic, i would have confronted me about it if i were in their shoes and it may have gotten me the help i needed sooner. because they turned a blind eye, it continued to fester and get worse. i understand that it's not their job to counsel me but such extreme behavior warrants attention, i was very sick and nobody helped me. there is one exception, in which we were watching a movie in class a year after i discontinued my in-class meat-beating. a risque scene comes on, and my teacher promply says, ""ok, settle down, john."" to which the class erupts into the most intense laughter i've ever heard that rings in my ears to this day. so if anything they made it worse. i quickly became known as that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class, bc, well.... i was that creepy kid that beat it in the back of class. i never stared at some chick's ass to set it off, mind you, if anything i blocked out the world to focus on my animalistic impulses. so if anyone wants to call me a gross creep, save it bc i'm already aware :( but this realization that it may not have been my fault, that i'm not a complete pervert really makes me feel better and could bring me at peace but i feel i cannot confirm it without getting some outside opinions and i don't want to go to anyone else (friends, family, etc.) other than my psychiatrist bc i'm so shameful of it and i fear they would look at me different for the rest of my life. i've just been hurting for such a long time and i'm desperate to get answers about this bc i'm too hung up on it and i likely will continue to be until i come to peace with it. thanks",bipolar,2

anyways. i have not had anyone that i feel comfortable telling this too because of the guilt i selfishly do not want to feel. i have been dealing with depression much of my life and the other night i felt so numb. i had felt like all of the emotion was drained out of my body. for some reason hanging myself felt like something i wanted to do. i had no great master plan, but i was genuinely feeling motivated to see what it felt like to hang myself and actually do it. i went to my shower door and tried a couple of jackets (they were all that i had that could work) and ended up finding this pink jacket that used to be my mom's and tightly double knoted it around my neck. i had multiple attempts cause the jacket was too stretchy, but was able to make it work. for some reason it felt right to be doing this. i stepped off the shower seat and felt the relief of the breath being taken out of me. i was easily able to stop the process and go back up on the step because it was not a far drop. i kind of wish i went through with it. at the same time i don't really want to go to hell if that's a thing. my whole life i have been chubby. ok maybe not to everyone's standards, but for mine. i have never liked my body and it only got worse as i got older. i eventually resorted to throwing up and bingeing. i am 21 now and had stopped for a while after high school, but ended up doing it again. i am fatter than ever and really do not like any part of how i look. i feel like i should just end it. i have a hard time seeing how i am suppose to live if i cannot even feel comfortable in this fucking skin suit i have to wear all the time. i got botched back when i was 18 and find that my body feels less like mine than it has ever felt. after three surgeries and 30,000 i still look fucked up. i hate being ugly, but have already drained the accounts of any money left to fix the issue. i feel like i am already too old and that my body is already ruined. i have scars where i thought i would never have them. i have always been obsessed with romance novels. ever since i was 13 they were my escape. those books and life in general taught me that romantic love will make a person happy. i have never had that. i am fearful that i never will. i feel like the people i liked always had someone prettier and less complicated to be with. it is never me. i think back to high school when i felt like i met the man of my dreams. he had a wonderful aura. he was tall and funny and nice and had the prettiest brown eyes that i had ever seen. his music taste was even more alternative like mine. he even loved the outdoors like me. i remember at the beginning of the semester we were texting until i heard two other girls in my grade liked him. once i heard this i stopped texting him. i knew that one of these two girls was the epitome of the perfect girl. she had the long blonde hair, was smart, and was skinny. i could never compete with her. i wished so bad to have been his date to prom. i know it may sound so childish to other people, but all i can think was that i was too stupid and too damn ugly to get the man i wanted. i still think about him sometimes to this day. i feel like i missed my shot. every other date i've been on since high school has not even come close to this dude. i even considered trying to go ""play for the other team,"" but i know that's not my real issue. i can't seem to feel that i do not have an other half and that someone already took him. ever since my parents divorced my senior year it feels like everything went down hill. i miss my old home. i miss having a home. now both my parents are remarried and happy and i cannot seem to get myself together. i feel that they will be sad if i left, but fine without me. i am just a waste of money for them. all i have done is spend all this money on surgery and health care to try and fix something that most likely can't be fixed anyways. i feel like all i do is take from them and am not even helpful in the slightest. i miss my old home. i miss my dog who passed away. i miss seeing her play in the yard. i miss having my family together. i miss my cat that passed away. i wish i would have spend more time with her and my dog. i feel that my family is gone. both my parents and even my brother have changed so much. i feel that i am the only one that has not changed. maybe i haven't had a boyfriend because i am meant to die a virgin. maybe i am just possessed or something. sometimes i blame it on being an aquarius, but i think we all know its not that. maybe all of the things i've lost over these couple of years was meant to happen so i could just go too. i needed to get this all out. it has all been weighing on me ever since i attempted to hang myself. i do not know the exact thing that came over me that night, but it scares me. i feel like it could happen again. what is the point of continuing on if it does happen again? i could not bear the idea of leaving a kid or even pet behind if i were to go through with suicide in the future. i feel like i have no real shot at life. to me this is all because i am just not pretty. i am sick of being fat. i am sick of

(i also identify somewhat strongly with adhd symptoms, which is prevalent in my family, but that has yet to be medically confirmed thanks to doctors being convinced that girl brain is impenetrable to adhd or something. but that’s neither here nor there at this point.) neither my depression nor my anxiety were brought on by something happening to me, but a lot of things have happened since then which have only served to exacerbate the problems. at the end of the day, i feel like my poor mental health has served only to reduce value from my life. it has made me not only less likely to seek out opportunities, but less eligible for them in the first place. when i see other people my age who aren’t mentally ill, the amount of friends they have, hobbies they can keep up with, things they’ve accomplished, i can’t help but be so jealous. in my current (natural) state, it would exhaust me to my core, but i still want it. why couldn’t i have been born with a functional brain and the capacity to actually be willing to take on responsibilities, push myself, *feel* *happy*? i recognize that everyone faces struggles in their lives, but i feel like i never even got to start my life because my brain was made with permanently shitty default settings. i wish i could have been that person with a genuinely well balanced life, who has a lot of friends, keeps up with hobbies, works out, succeeds in school, loves their job. i know i tried to be, but any time i start to get into the territory of any kind of demanding responsibility outside of the home, i feel like i’ve spread myself too thin and i’m a few bad weeks away from a mental health emergency. don’t get me wrong, i do have a few close friends, and most of the time i can get out of bed and take care of myself in the most basic sense, and i recognize that people in the world generally tend to like me because i’m conventionally attractive and i make a joke out of everything. the anxiety forces me to put up a front of a pretty, but slightly frazzled manic pixie dream girl type of personality, but a lot more detriment goes on behind the scenes. it’s like my brain is holding me hostage, and i have to smile for the world and pretend like it doesn’t have a gun against my back. i know it’s possible for people to manage symptoms and lead successful lives, but i feel like i’ve exhausted my resources in terms of tools to improve myself. i have tried too many negative coping mechanisms, self harm, food restriction, jumping into shitty relationships to feel *something*, alcohol, weed, pushing myself to exhaustion because maybe i could just force myself to success (none of this worked, obviously. don’t try it.) then i tried positive coping mechanisms like therapy, yoga/meditation, journaling/mindfulness, medication, quitting medication to focus on my ~natural self~, eating well, straight up pretending to be happy, which is excruciating and also didn’t work. my brain is hard wired for self destruction, and unless there’s some kind of miracle cure i somehow haven’t heard of yet, i doubt i’ll get to where i wish i was. but anyways, people who can just say yes to a new project, or a new chapter in their life, or anything, really, have no idea how much some of us would give to be able to take on even a fraction of that. i’m not lazy, i’m not a faker, i’m a real person with a real illness that prevents me from living the way i wish i could. it sucks.",depression,3

4958f5ae-67fd-46a6-831c-5841a3ca2ffe,"travelling off-the-beaten-path can be good for many reasons; “unspoiled” nature or charm, peace and quiet, photo opportunities without people getting in the way, more chances to talk to locals instead of staying within foreigner circles, cheaper entrance fees or restaurants, less touristy souvenirs and junk shops… but i’ll start off by saying that **this is not an “attack” on the-beaten-path travel**. there's a reason why there’s a beaten path, maybe because those monuments or sites have a lot of history and were important before international tourism was a thing, sometimes a place is simply very cool and everyone wants to go there, sometimes because it’s easy to access from the capital or along the way between sites, and it can be very good to visit the known places because it has signs in your language if the language barrier is something that makes you nervous, you don’t have to worry about getting lost, it’s your first time abroad or in that country and you aren’t ready to go off-the-beaten-path yet… and many of us just want to see machu picchu and the eiffel tower regardless of crowds or how “typical” it is. **there is no one right way of travelling**. my reason for making this post is simply because many times it can feel like we’ll be spending our time surrounded by crowds, or we’re questioning whether that cultural theme park is really our best option to get to know a country’s culture, or the sites just seem really expensive and there *has* to be a cheaper option, and sometimes it can be hard to know where to look to find these alternatives. here are some ideas on how to find some new spots: ## **discovering new places** **1. use google maps** i use google maps for everything. when i say “use google maps”, i mean this in many different ways: - **create a world map** and continuously add places to it, regardless of whether you’re planning a trip there. for example, i see a photo of the [csav in chile and i think “i’d like to see that!”. but by the time i actually go to chile, possibly many years from now, i’ll have forgotten the csav even exists. this is why, when i hear or see something i like, i put it on the map and it makes sure i remember them when the time comes to visit that area. [this is my current world - if you’ve already started planning a trip, **know where the places you’ll be visiting are**. “i was thinking of sleeping in tokyo and doing day trips to kyoto and nara from there”, as a japan travel consultant i hear things like this all the time, it’s because people haven’t really looked at a map. this can be helpful not only for understanding the geography and locations of the sites you’ll be going to, grouping sites together by areas so it’ll be easier and quicker to move around between them, but also to find other places along the way. say you’re going from beijing to shanghai, they’re far away, there’s probably something interesting to do along the way! what other stops does the bullet train do? do any names stand out on the map? is there a strange colour or water formation that looks interesting? sometimes you can simply ask someone who knows the country well: “hey, are there any worthwhile stops between shanghai and beijing?” - **look at the icons on google maps**. i was adding the notre dame in paris to my map and i realised there are so many things to do in the area, just by [looking at the i hadn’t heard of le palais du luxembourg, place dauphine, institut du monde arabe, musée carnavalet… these may not be off-the-beaten-path, but it’s still a quick and easy way to discover things. &amp;nbsp; **2. let images guide you** - the first thing i always do when starting to plan a trip to a new destination is open google images and type in “(country) tourism”. so if i’m planning a trip to slovenia, is what’ll come out. lake bled, piran, skocjan caves, ljubljana, styria’s wine fields, postojna cave and kamnik are places that i hear about first of all. now that i know something about the country, i can add these to my map if the photos look interesting (i don’t research anything about them yet, i’ll do that later, this is purely judging from an image search) and i’ll have enough for the next steps. - look up the places individually. often when you google a place, other suggestions will come up. for example, [here i am searching for the viti and, as you can see, at the top there are other recommendations: hrossaborg horse city, hverarönd namafjall […], myvatn nature baths… these are sometimes things that others have searched for when looking up the viti crater, sometimes they can be nearby spots, sometimes it’s places that aren’t even in the same country but are similar… open them all! [the can be used similarly. - related to above is another google images feature, [“related when you click on an image. make sure to look at the different images featured and often the title or description will have the name of the other place. it’s a good way to find similar places often at the other side of the country or simply cheaper / lesser known. after about an hour of doing these two things, is what my map of iceland looked like, pink the places i thought were really cool, they’ll be my must-sees, and brown the regular-cool places to visit if i have spare time. - **search for abstract places**. “vietnam waterfall”, “algeria caves”, “germany modern statues”… whatever! you know what you like, so search for that thing specifically. i always search for ruins and caves and history museums. many of these sites may not appear in guide books but they are often worth a visit because you’ve searched for that thing knowing it was something you’d enjoy. - not just sites, but **restaurants and/or hotels too**! just search “tanzania restaurants” and you can find some amazing for foodies especially, sometimes making a visit to a town or city especially so you can eat at that specific place can make the trip much more worthwhile than if you’re simply going with what you find next to the museum. - **use the local language**! if you’re going to france you can search for “cave”, but searching for “grotte” may give you some different options. - **get lost in pinterest**. once you’ve found a cool image on pinterest about the country you’re going to, just let yourself wander around looking at the other images and places you’ll find there. i especially like pinterest because they are images posted by people who have no clue about the place (and i say this with all the respect in the world, it’s an advantage!). even though pinterest is full of this image, nobody who goes to japan would actually go to the [spiral simply because it’s in the middle of *nowhere* and many people (who don’t use pinterest) don’t know it exists. because people of pinterest haven’t been to the places they post, they are not suggestions “tainted” by how easy or difficult it is to visit them, how close or far away they are, how expensive it is, etc. they are purely suggestions based on how good they look. if that’s what you’re looking for, not biased opinions but simply *places*, then this is one of the best options to look. &amp;nbsp; **3. just ask people!** this may seem very obvious, but i think sometimes many of us forget to do this, simply ask people who know the place well or live there what their favourite places are. i live in barcelona and every autumn i make a trip to i also really like [la fageda d'en i don’t know if foreign visitors go there often, but i really think they should if they like nature. people who know the country will know about places that tourists don’t. &amp;nbsp; ## **making the most of your trip** **1. determining your must-sees** what i like: traditional architecture and history (especially prehistory), volcanoes, caves and rocks, temples (bonus points if secluded), ruins and castles, listening to people speak other languages (actual interaction not required). some will think that once you visit one castle then you’ve kind of seen them all; some will visit some ruins and stay there for under an hour because “there wasn’t much to see”; some will prefer to simply read the pamphlet at the entrance instead of building family trees and timelines before their trip; some will get frustrated about the lack of communication and signs they don’t understand or not having anyone to talk to when they travel alone to a foreign country where nobody speaks your language. i don’t like bars and pubs because i don’t drink, amusement parks are terrible because they’re expensive and i’m scared of heights. i don’t want to waste my time at beaches abroad considering i’m from spain and spend almost half the year at the beach anyway. that’s okay! other people’s tastes will be different, that’s the whole point, *people’s tastes are different*. don’t be afraid or embarrassed to say “nah, i’ll pass and do something cooler for me”. **you have limited time on your trip** and you should spend that time doing something you really enjoy. don’t add places that people say are “must-sees” to your list simply because they’re *supposed* to be really good, go to that place that you thought was interesting, even if others will shrug at it. i think this is the most important thing about travelling: **do what you love above anything else**. i made this mistake many times on my first solo trip, and sometimes i still think “well, it’s really famous, so i should go there”, but i can confidently say that my favourite places are the ones that i went out of my way to see simply because *i* was excited about them. this doesn’t mean going off the beaten track is best, sometimes what you’ll want to do is visit a very common place, and that’s a good option too, just make sure you’re visiting that place because *you* want to, and not because other people say it’s really good. **there are no universal must-sees, only personal ones**, you can’t do everything so choose what you love. somewhat related to this is another point: **people have different budgets when travelling**. i’m a backpacker. i’m not going to pay 29,000 yen for a jr pass to ride the bullet train up and down in japan, that’s about the amount of money i spend for 11-12 nights in a hostel. i’ll use the night bus and arrive to kyoto at 5am with a crick in my neck but *for me* it will be worth it, what a bargain! others wouldn’t dream of travelling like this. it all boils down to **people having different priorities**. think about what your priorities are. &amp;nbsp; **2. avoiding crowds** people-watching can be entertaining, but sometimes we just really want a place to ourselves. there are many ways to go about this, even for the most famous sites. - the easiest way is simply to **wake up early**. if it’s a museum, residence, castle or any other place with an opening time, you’ll want to be there as soon as it opens. if it doesn’t have an opening time because it’s outside, it’s a building, observation decks and scenic views, etc., go even earlier. many people don’t like waking up early when they’re on holiday and tour buses tend to arrive around 10-11am. sometimes this will work and sometimes it won’t, but i’ve found that it is generally the most successful way. - **go when nobody else wants to go**. is it raining? fantastic! few tourists go outside in the rain, make the most of it and go to all the outdoor sites then. - **backstreets exist too, go for a walk!** i often walk to a site if it’s around or under 30min instead of taking the bus, sometimes that’s more interesting than the actual site itself. - **the closer to the capital, the more popular it will be**. i say capital, but really any popular destination city works. for example, everyone goes to the blue lagoon in iceland, but there are similar alternatives for hot spring bathing around the country. if that’s an option for you, perhaps simply go out a bit further. &amp;nbsp; **3. travel isn’t only about which places you want to see, but also about experiences** do you have a bucket list? perhaps you should. many people don’t like them, but i personally do, this is just a suggestion. a bucket list isn’t supposed to be a checklist, it’s a reminder. it doesn’t even have to be in the form of a list, it can be a folder on your computer full of images or ideas, it can be a folder of newspaper cutouts, a blog where you repost interesting things you want to do, etc. i mean things such as “use a pottery wheel; learn how to snowboard; meet a nun”. something i’ve always wanted to do is throw a message in a bottle into the sea. i took the ferry from italy back home and i realised later on that it would’ve been a perfect opportunity to try it out, but i didn’t remember at the time! doing these things in a different country can be more exciting than doing them at home, because it’s a moment in which you have the time to try new things. when you travel, think of things you want to try and do, not just see. &amp;nbsp; **4. travel ethically** i won’t get into this too much because everyone draws the line in different places when it comes to morality, this isn’t supposed to be a controversial post. but i want to at least mention it because i think it’s quite important. nothing is going to ruin your trip more than coming to spain to see bullfighting and ending up upset because you didn’t know exactly what bullfighting in spain is like, or riding an elephant in thailand and later learning about what happens behind-the-scenes. are you buying your souvenirs from someone who is harming the local community or economy by importing products or underpaying their workers? are you visiting an aquarium that gets its dolphins from the same people who kill and eat dolphins? are you going to shifen in taiwan to release paper lanterns without having in mind the serious environmental problems that these lanterns suppose? it’s impossible to know about everything, many times you have to look this up yourself because nobody is going to tell you, but especially when it comes to animals; try to know before you go. &amp;nbsp; well then, this is where i end my monologue. i hope this has helped any of you who may have been having trouble planning a trip, or at the very least start an interesting discussion in the comments. if you feel i missed anything important, feel free to add below!",none,5
c78bd8d6-c9ae-4947-a876-59d7302ed80b,"i live in america. last year i went to visit my grandma in the netherlands for a month. when i got there, the first thing i noticed was how clean and orderly everything was. the houses were very nice, the architecture was modern and beautiful, and to me it felt like i was in the future. when i got back, i began to notice that everything seemed very dirty and run down. i was noticing a lot more how the roads and sidewalks were discolored and dirty, the buildings were in poorer condition, and how everything in general just felt... worse. it almost felt like i was in a slum. of course america's standard of living is very high, but compared to the netherlands, america (or at least the city i live in) seems very run down and filthy. i got used to it after a while, but i thought it was interesting how it really puts the incredibly high standard of living in the netherlands into perspective. has anyone experienced something similar? if so, what country do you live in and what country did you visit?",none,5

860fb783-c9be-4bfd-a592-4d81b60e4de8,"several of you have probably at least heard his name associated with the red hot chili peppers, and justly so. many would say he's one of the greatest band guitarists of all time, and he is, in my opinion, the greatest modern guitarist. but too few know that after he split from the band around 2008, he's had a killer solo career as well. generally his songs have a mellower, sometimes more acoustic sound than rhcp's funk, but they're just as engaging if you're in the right mood for them. this jibes quite well with his role in the band as well, because he was always the one bringing the melody to rhcp's otherwise funky sound, and his eccentric, reserved personality always had a way of showing through in interviews, live performances, and even music videos. his replacement in the band, josh klinghoffer, was introduced and more or less mentored by john himself, and he is a very talented musician in his own right. even so, somethings clearly missing in today's chili peppers. each lineup they've had has given them a bit of a new identity, but rhcp as most think of them couldn't exist without john and the chemistry he had with chad, flea, and anthony. just now i was listening to one of his solo songs, titled the will to death, and i just felt so overcome with emotion. i was reminded of what a shame it is that more people aren't familiar with the works of one of the greatest singers, guitarists, and lyricists i've had the pleasure of hearing, and i felt compelled to make this post. if other frusciante fans want to share their favorite songs or anything that they appreciate about him, please go for it. edit: some of my favorites here's one he collaborated with klinghoffer on. not my all time favorite of his, but the crescendo it reaches toward the end is brilliant and their voices go together very well. murderers, falling, and wayne have no vocals, but the guitar work is brilliant enough that they don't really need any. this one's pretty underrated, even compared to his other work. /u/matwick reminded me of this /u/jeffersonfull reminded me of this which reminded me of this /u/young_ed mentioned this one, a bit slow, but well worth it and that reminded me of this song as recommended by /u/comala93 will post more as they come to mind he's also very impressive live. he's got some great covers not to mention his performances during the standard rhcp fare. there's also fan made frusciante site at i've never looked much at it, but it might be a neat thing to check out if you're interested in him.",none,5

225e2ef0-32d2-4e08-bfc7-b8fe591e334c,"a family member has had a long history being drawn to pyramid schemes. this is the latest iteration. because math sadly isn’t quite my forte, i thought it might be interesting to offer it up to reddit and see what other people’s take is on it. i guess i’m curious to see the scheme unveiled a little more thoroughly than i could unveil it on my own. it’s called ‘the triangle’. *chuckles* here’s how it works: x xx xxxx xxxxxxxx let’s call each x an investor. there are four levels and 15 investors in total. let’s refer to the topmost level as level one, and the bottom as level four. the theory is that all of the money contained within this pyramid is gifted to the investor who has reached level one. that is 75k (5k x 15). alternately, if the investor reaching level one does not contribute, which makes more sense, that total comes down to 70k (5k x 14). therefore, 70k is the total contained within the pyramid every time a payout is granted. so let’s take that as our total moving forward; 70k is paid out to the investor at level one. upon reaching level one, every investor will have been in the pyramid 4 times. each will have contributed 3 times; once for each of levels four, three, and two. each investor contributes 15k (5k x 3) and walk away with a 55k gain after reaching level one (70k - 15k). sounds pretty good, right? in order for the pyramid to keep its shape, for there to be only 1 benefactor at level one, 2 at level two, and 4 at level three, this pyramid must help build more pyramids. so how does that work? let’s call them turns. each turn (each time people move up the pyramid), 1 of the 2 investors at level two reaches level one in a different pyramid, 2 of the investors at level three join a different pyramid (reaching level two), and 4 of the investors at level four join a different pyramid (reaching level three). this means that every turn, 7 people move to a new pyramid. and that’s ok, so long as every empty spot is filled, the pyramid keeps its shape and always holds 70k. so that is our final number: 55k (70k - 15k). that is the maximum gain one can make. that’s if the investor walks away; if they decide to no longer partake in the pyramid (the idea, though, is that they’d ideally like to see you invest anew). given that it takes 14 investors in order for 1 to get the jackpot, it naturally follows that it takes 210 investors in order for all 15 investors present in the first pyramid to get the same. and in the midst of this process, some 14 more pyramids have been created, 8 new investors walking in each time at level four. so by the time each of the 15 souls in the first pyramid has won its share, 112 more (8 x 14) are hoping for the same, and because it takes 14 investors in order for 1 to see that dream come true, it’ll take 1568 investors (112 x 14) for them to ever reach the top. and on and on, forever. so aside from the obvious (that the only way to sustain these pyramids is by constantly dragging more people into the fold), i’m curious to see if any of you can shine a light on other potential problems with this pyramid scheme.",none,5

(she got female colleagues number somehow, called her and asked her questions such as ""is there a really too much work at office? , who all stay late at office?"" like that.) within six months of marriage she filed for divorce. now this guy, he went into depression and started being late to the office,he wouldn't complete his work on time cause he was always distracted. he started receiving flak for it in the office. he became more n more depressed. he had accident few months back, i don't know but maybe because he was distracted while driving. today he was let go because of poor performance. devoting yourself to the work is good. but, be aware there is life outside of the work. there is your family who loves you. do not neglect them for work. because, if it comes to it your employer will replace you within 3 months(notice period😅). that's all i have to say. thank you for reading. tldr: witnessed persons life getting destroyed because of work pressure. wrote this to remind you that there is life outside of office.",none,5

(hell, i once came across two flights, one was 36 hours long, cost $600, the other was 16 hours long and cost $650. is $50 worth 20 less hours, probably.) europe is lucky to have all of those budget airlines, but while they can be sweet, they will nickel and dime you for everything. they'd charge you for air if they could. - booking hostels directly is nearly always 10-15% cheaper than the booking sites out there, and they will price match. also makes problems infinitely easier to fix. the one downside is you're open to foreign transaction fees, which leads into my next point, which you briefly touched on. - if you're from the united states i highly suggest looking into a charles schwab checking account. makes life easier, and safer so you don't have to pull out the max and walk around with a lot of cash. they will refund you all atm fees and there are no transaction fees for foreign purchases. when you open one they give you a brokerage account, which you don't have to use, and there are no yearly fees on either account.",none,5

caa71704-8f68-40d2-b49f-277a4fb63e75,"hi everyone, so to give a little background i was diagnosed with severe ptsd almost two years ago and heavily recommended a service dog (not a therapy dog, a service dog *see google for difference*) to help assist with my daily functioning, being that i was not functioning nor able to function normally at that time. my options were to shell out upwards to $20,000 for a service dog (if i could find one,) go thru an organization (non-profit that trains ptsd service dogs), or obtain my own dog and train it myself in hopes that it is well-tempered, intelligent, and driven to work as an adult dog. i did not have $8,000, nonetheless $20,000 at that time, nor was i able to hold a job or receiving any sort of financial assistance (even from family.) so i then went ahead and filled out numerous applications to various organizations in hopes to be approved and then put on a waitlist for a service dog. unfortunately i was turned down by every single organization because they only catered to veterans. this was extremely defeating being how severe my trauma was and how much i was struggling to even attempt to function at this point. so i spent months looking for the right dog/breed/temperament/circumstance/etc... and i finally found the right little man last october. i have been training him with the help of private trainers and obedience classes, and let me tell you this is hard work. but without him i don't even know if i would still be around- he has changed my life in ways that i wasn't even able to consider or imagine 8 months ago. everyone who is struggling with debilitating ptsd, i strongly encourage to get a ptsd service dog. so here is where i need advice: (if you are still reading- thank you!..) i still am unable to work, however i hope it is not like this forever. since having gone through being turned down by so many organizations to the point that i have almost given up, and then to have experienced the incredible benefits first-hand of having a service dog i have been wanting to do something... i have had this idea in the works for almost 9 months now. i want to start an organization that provides service dogs (not therapy dogs) to those diagnosed with severe ptsd dealing with severe domestic and sexual violence that has left them unable to function normally as a young woman/man or adult. i have tossed the idea around to a few peers but i think their obliged to support me on any goal i have being that i have barely been able to think about the week ahead- nonetheless long-term goals. the organization would be fronted by a business (potentially an online clothing/apparel store) that the revenue goes toward funding this organization (along with donations) so that the service dogs can be offered free of charge to these victims. i went from taking 4-6 medications/day (8mg of xanax, 2mg ambien, trazadone, celexa, 50mg seroquel...etc...) to now only having xanax with me as a back-up that i use maybe once or twice a week as needed. that may seem like a drastic change but it totally happened organically. the incredible safety, love, and support (emotional and physical) that my service dog has and continues to give me has surpassed any medication or therapy i have been able to find or try. i want young women/men to be able to feel, see, and experience that hope again the way i have. although my life and ptsd is something i continue to struggle with daily, my sd has made it so i can at least manage my symptoms constructively and i am able to channel my energy and love toward him and his training. i really feel passionate about this and.. i want you to tell me what you think! i can take constructive criticism, so please voice pros and cons of this concept, and how/if you think it would be beneficial for our fellow souls suffering from this debilitating illness. thank you so much!",ptsd,4

5d9164f9-cab5-41a2-8b90-6a8ef4e9328f,"for most of my life, i’ve been riddled with various mental health issues. it’s caused me to have unrealistic expectations for how friends and family “should” help or offer support for me which, in turn, has caused a lot of issues with people sometimes ending relationships. with ptsd, and now atsd, i’ve just given up trying to make people follow this unrealistic narrative and accept that person 1 is my fun friend for fun things, not a therapist, or family member 3 is understanding if i have to cancel plans due to ptsd but not someone i can talk to about details. that leads to yesterday when i get to my moms house where my nephew is glueing tissue paper onto a chicken cut out for a craft day with grandma. him and i are going through the bag of goodies he and my mom got at michael’s and there’s a wiggly squeeze thing that if you squeeze it, it bubbles out. we marvel at how cool his grandma is. after dropping off my nephew off with his mom, my mom and i are at her house again when she digs the little critter out and says she saw it and “had to get it” because it reminded her of the stress ball i’ve been squeezing lately. (i’m sorry, i don’t english well even as a native speaker) this little dude has little flimsy spikes all over and squishy feet. she said she thought that because it’s easy to squeeze, it’s soft, and it’s long enough to toss from hand to hand, it’d make a great sensory item for me. it’s the coolest thing someone has done/thought of for me and this morning, the next day, i’m overcome with love from her. even if she sometimes says some really messed up things without thinking, or actually has forgotten my trauma happened, she cares. she supports. she tries. and that’s so important to know. she doesn’t need to be perfect, she doesn’t need to be a balls to the wall activist (though it’d be cool), she’s there in ways she can be and that’s enough. i think it’s helped me immensely to accept that people help how they can, and sometimes it doesn’t align with what i’d want or do myself, but they’re not me nor are they a licensed mental health professional.",ptsd,4

could be suffering from - rather i just thought that i was a kid who had typical abusive parents that every chinese kid had and as a result, i have high levels of anxiety and depression. i thought ptsd was more reserved for individuals who dealt with high levels of trauma such as sexual abuse, war, murder, etc. because he's my friend and i felt like i've told him enough about my abusive life, i didn't want to get into the deeper details because i felt it might ruin our friendship, so i am asking you guys. i know you're not in any position to give a professional diagnosis but...i just want to know if it's possible. i just need someone to listen and know. something. i was also told growing up, ""this is how chinese parents teach their kids, because chinese parents love them unlike your white friends whom their parents let them do whatever they want, because they don't care."" a brief overview of me and notable events (usually occurring more than once)in my life that i can still remember to this day * male, asian descent * was physically/emotionally abused as a child by mother, father, aunt and grandmother * beaten with belts and several household items * was stripped naked and forced to stand outside my house for two hours when i did poorly in school. * accidentally fell down the stairs and when i cried for my mom expecting hugs, she beat me relentlessly saying that it was my fault. * being told to stand for 10 hours with both my arms up and being whipped by sticks on my sides when they lower below my shoulders. my dad would sit in a chair next to me and because i was crying i couldn't tell if he had his eyes open or not, so sometimes being whipped could suddenly happen * getting a bad report card from school and while taking the bus home i would feel faint, vision changes/blackening because i was anticipating being beaten that night * being suddenly yanked out of bed in the middle of the night and getting yelled at and beaten because my parents found my report card (or even a failed test from three years ago). i recall being pulled by my hair down the stairs. * being told to stick out both hands and my dad would hold a bamboo stick over them; he'd hover over each hand and move between them while saying stuff like ""what did you do wrong?"" and then smack the palm of my hand, depending on whether i answered properly or just smack them and then expect me to give the proper answer. sometimes the proper answer would still mean getting hit and i'd have to repeat it to ensure that it drills into my head. sometimes he could force me to count each time my palms was hit. * hiding under the kitchen table to isolate certain parts of my body from being hit that were incredibly sensitive. so if my dad kept hitting my shoulder, i would position myself and also put all my focus into ensuring and expecting that my shoulder was hit. if i did this, it almost created a numbing effect. however, my dad would make sure to hit other parts of my body, like my ears or my feet. this caused immense pain and i can recall how it would cause me to spasm and scream and break me out of the ""focus"" * being chased and beaten by my dad and running towards my mom for protection while she was washing dishes : i recall her kicking me away from her. that hurt me so much. * being deprived of sleep by not allowing me to go to bed and instead, sit in my knees and pray to a statue of buddha and repeatedly say things like ""i will do well in school"", ""i will be a good son"", ""i will not lie"" * being forced to recite books in french for hours. my dad would sleep on the chair and if he noticed i stopped or slept, he would hit me. if i finished the book he'd tell me ""read it again from the beginning"". he would place the bamboo stick in front of me. * falling into a puddle in public and as i would get up, my mom would smack me behind the head saying ""you made me lose face"" and literally wanting to die from everyone staring at me * in kindergarten, we had to change our pants for gym class and teacher saw my bruising/whip marks on my legs. i was brought into the office by my teacher and i felt like i did something wrong. my parents would tell me about how because of me being bad and getting the whip marks, the government is going to take me away and i'm never going to see them nor my sisters even again. * being hit by a broom on the top of my head that caused an open wound. because i had hair it was easily hidden, so during the weekend it closed up and i constantly picked it when i was stressed. teachers at school thought i had lice. i still have this habit today. * occasionally when i was a kid, i would wake up in the middle of the night crying because i had intense difficulty breathing. i was diagnosed as having asthma....but the strange thing is that i can't recall this feeling during the day nor during gym class. it was only at night and sometimes i would find myself pulling my favorite blanket in front of my parents' door crying myself to sleep while struggling to breathe. * my mom would invite her friend and her son (whom we were around the same age) but because i failed an exam that day, i couldn't play with him and instead my mom would force me to stand in the living room with both my arms up and hit me if my arms dropped. she would shame/complain about me to her friend while doing so, and then say ""look at your friend. why aren't you more like him? he's a good son unlike you."" - i just avoided eye contact with my friend and his mom and basically just phased out while crying. * coming back from every parent teacher interview and while driving back in the car my dad would say things like ""i'm going to beat you until you die"" and me sitting in the back crying and just hoping that it's going to be over and i'm going to wake up tomorrow because it was a bad dream, waking up and realizing i'm still in the car and we are heading closer to home and my dad was going to take the clothes hanger and beat me. * ""tutoring"" me in chinese spelling involved my mom saying ""i'm giving three hours to study. i'm going to test you later after."" and involved me standing next to to a blackboard while she was holding a feather duster. * the worst nightmare i had was something i just couldn't put my finger on - i cannot visually describe the details but it was the feeling of having all of my blood drained from my limbs, the incoming feeling of about to vomit and having something stuck in my throat, combined with the feeling of having to run because i feel i'm being chased. this same feeling would occasionally occur irl during periods of high stress. i could recall some periods in my childhood where i was beaten 3-4 days in a row. could any of these actually ptsd or am i just over thinking it? i am a first generation asian born in canada and because of that i felt that because of the cultural differences this isn't something that could cause ptsd to me specifically . i've spoken to other chinese kids growing up and they all tell me ""yeah my parents have beaten me"", so because of that i've always thought it was a ""normal"" thing and that non chinese kids i could never relate to them. i just feel alone most of the time and i feel because of these experiences, i could never tell potential partners. at the same times i would feel so much guilt because i'm hiding this away from them. this feeling of ""wanting to vomit"", blood draining from limbs, similar to my nightmare, happens when i'm in social situations....especially where there's validation

(i do that pretty much, i can be unsecure about that though, but i want to let it go, and dont want to be a controlling boyfriend. nor for her, or for me. than she gets mad she couldnt bring me a kiss at almost 5 o clock in the morning. i told her, that it was really sweet she wanted to do that, but i really needed to sleep and it was too late for it. and then a short moment after i fell asleep i get quite a lot text messages, that at least another dude do want her to sleep over, that im a shit guy, and so on. i honestly dont think i can live long with this, but i do care about her and want to do something back for her. i was pretty much done with my live and lost all fate and interest in things. she was the one that got me back on these things. and beside these moments i have a good time with her aswell. she will get therapy for her ptsd in a couple months if that's true. but i wonder if she got more problems than only ptsd. is this something you guys recognise aswell? by the way i hope my topic is in the right subreddit. forgive me if its not.",ptsd,4
