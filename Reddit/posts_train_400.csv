289150ec-1ebd-44e0-9211-91feb57ef122,"all my life i’ve noticed that it’s hard for me to put time and effort into friendships, but sometimes i’ll even fixate on one person i guess until i move on to someone else. i never did this on purpose or to be hurtful, if anything i’ve usually noticed people move on from me if that happens. this didn’t really hit me until this past year when one of my friends called me out on this and even if it hurt at first i realized they were right. i also find it hard to have the motivation to see if i want to hang out with some friends and i often as myself if it’s worth the trouble or anxiety to try and do so. i just always worry that my friends might find me too overbearing or annoying since sometimes when i’m too happy to be around someone, i do get hyper. i guess my point/question is how am i able to find a happy medium with friendships and social skills that seems to come naturally for nts? it seems like they don’t have as much of an issue as those who have adhd/other disorders. i just want to be able to hang out with people more often (finding the motivation i guess) without worrying if i’m being too much or anything of the sort.

7a94c538-d2e9-40a5-8595-72a8695263ed,"i'm having complicated feelings here. my husband is thankfully getting better but has been sick for the last month with what we suspect is covid. (he had a negative test, but has all the symptoms. we are in a hard hit area and i've never seem him this sick this long including 2 visits to urgent care / er. we just went for antibody tests today.) more recently he has been complaining of brain fog and feeling mentally slow and forgetful. for the last couple of days he'll make flabbergasted remarks like, ""oh my god! i walked into the room and couldn't remember why i came in here! can you believe that?"" and ""look honey, i set my water down here and i forgot where i put it."" and then, ""i went back into the kitchen for my water and i still didnt bring it back, just my coffee."" he says these things with a mix of disbelief and humor, while at other times he expresses a lot of anxiety about these and other symptoms. this is... such a mixed bag for me. i've been really worried about him and i'm really glad he's getting better. i'm still worried because he's usually very organized and it's true, any change in cognitive function can be a cause for concern. especially because he's been dealing with a ton of obnoxious and scary and ever changing symptoms for a month and counting. most of the time i've been reacting with humor as well. but i've also been saying - ""you mean you dont usually do that?"" and, ""you know, you are basically describing things that i do probably 20 times per day and have always done for my entire life. welcome to my level!"" it's strange to me that this seems so remarkable to him because it is so everyday for me. i am also having a hard time because, while things have gotten a lot better between us, we definitely have a history of him criticizing me for this exact type of thing. setting things down and leaving them because i've forgotten about them, getting off track and delayed because i'm not totally keeping track of what i'm supposed to be doing. he's always been the more organized and disciplined one. part of me wants to scream, ""now you know how it feels!"" of course, i dont know what it feels like to have covid or whatever bug this is since i didnt get sick, so maybe we're like even?",adhd,0

""why yes, i'll continue to gorge myself on junk food and watch shitty youtube videos instead of getting actual work done."" it also has the added benefit of making the meds useless, so hooray for thumping side effects with no actual benefit. if i don't prioritize sleep, i can basically guarantee that *nothing* i'm supposed to get done the next day is happening. finally, as the added *coup de grace,* lack of sleep makes you procrastinate on everything, *including going to bed to sleep.* i swear, talk about a disorder of vicious cycles.",adhd,0
8e6fdd2d-bf9d-47b2-ba8f-62eafc5e8aaf,"my 8 year old son was formally diagnosed with adhd earlier this week and prescribed vyvanse. i have been in almost daily communication with his teacher this year as we've tried to help him get through the school year, so i let her know that he had taken his first pill this morning. she sent me feedback this afternoon that he worked great in a group today, he wasn't distracted by the other kids around him, and he found something out of place at recess and put it away which is incredibly observant and out of character for him. he also got all his schoolwork done on time, which is a major struggle for him. when he got home, he told me he felt smarter today and i noticed immediately that he isn't getting distracted in the middle of his sentences and taking a lot longer than others would to say what he's trying to say. he seems more direct. and guys.. i'm freaking crying. this is the boy i've always known he was, coming out of the fog. i'm sure this is not the end of his journey with learning to live with adhd, but it seems like a milestone. the fear and worry that has been weighing on us both as he fell farther and farther behind his peers is a little less today and i'm so thankful for it.",adhd,0

0d29d7b2-814d-4331-b054-d011a5e42b34,"i have always struggled to sleep since ever. and when i started medication this only got worse. i quit medication a year ago, and sleep got slightly better. but it would still take me 2-3 hours to fall asleep. then, about a month ago i hit a brick wall of stress, guilt and bad planning. i went on sick leave for 2 weeks. during that time i improved my workflow / todo list and i started meditating using the headspace app. (ios) the app teaches you to relax and be mindful. basically it tricks you into calming down. and two weeks into the training, i started falling asleep without effort. none. i just do the routine from the training and i fall asleep. it is like magic. sorry. but this is a huge thing for me. maybe it can help you too, so i wanted to share. and just as a disclaimer, i have no idea how or why this works, or if it's some placebo effect. but at this point i don't care. because now i'm even more calm and less hot headed during the day. and i can sleep at will. at will!!! :d and one more disclaimer: i've read multiple sources say that this kind of meditation can surface buried mental issues / traumas. so that's something to keep in mind if you want to try it out. edit: just to clarify. this isn't a learn how to sleep app. it's an app that teaches you to meditate. and it's that knowledge that has enabled me to sleep, not the app directly. i don't use it at night.",adhd,0

8c0b3da0-08b3-47e2-b6e7-c8aff952b338,"so it finally happened. i couldn't keep putting out the little trail of fires i was leaving in my work and they just caught up to me and burned me out. however... i'm reacting a lot better than i thought. i told my company about my adhd after i was diagnosed. i was diagnosed just before christmas and i told them shortly after. i was being completely honest with them, i told them i wanted to have it out in the open, and for it not to come up during a situation where it would seem like an excuse for something (at the time i was holding things together quite well) they were quite supportive and they asked me for info or advice regarding it. afterwords i was able to get back into a really productive flow for about a month, i was working so god damn well and i was the happiest i'd been in a while in regards to my work. i couldn't keep it going come the start of february. things started to slip and i basically shut down. i was so worn out that i was getting constant headaches and i felt physically sick. i'm not on medication so it wasn't a side effect or anything, it was stress. i was trying so hard to keep that enthusiasm and that level of work. cut to today, i had a meeting with my manager and we were talking about the past month, all the slip ups and issues that happened. things i honestly thought i had done, but were embarrassingly not even partly finished. she handled the situation very, very professionally. we spoke about the fact that it is in no way a reflection of my character, she said i'm a very good fit in regards to the teams dynamic. but that the inconsistencies in my work were a problem, which is fairly obviously true. we're a client facing company, my inconsistencies and my slip ups have a major impact on the reputation of the company itself. so after some more discussion we came to an agreement that for both parties it would be better for me to leave. i understand the role, i know what this job entails, and i do agree that it is the right decision for myself and for the company at the current time. i like to think when i get things under control that i could come back and truly be able to do my job consistently, i like the team, i like the perks of the job and the experiences that come from it. i'm going to use this as a reason to really evaluate what i need to do with myself. this is the first time where my adhd has put a roadblock in my way as opposed to a hurdle. so i'm going to use this time to either find a way around it, or i'll just find a better road.",adhd,0

21140c33-7443-42b7-9461-b74bf3fcff6c,"that psych today article was an anxious read for me because it was too on point. it’s so accurate— it’s scary, but also relieving because i know i’m not alone in feeling like a deadbeat. i hate being perceived as lazy and acting lazy when my mind is actually moving so quickly that i can’t keep up and i’m full of enthusiasm for novelty but i can’t channel that into real life activity or sustain an activity over the long-term. social anxiety is part of the reason, but the underlying reason is that i lack the self-control and intrinsic motivation others seem to have. i just want constant stimulation and dopamine. maybe i just don’t have enough adversity in my life to drive me toward a goal. i did fine in school because i was fast and the work was easy. as long as i had a structured environment, i could kind of keep it together. as soon as i leave the structured environment and go home, i’m a mess. my self-direction compass is spinning out of control and i’m stuck in place while time is flying past me until it’s time for the next obligation i’m already thinking of excuses to get out of. --- i stopped feeling like i’m performing at the level of my capability right after puberty— i became apathetic, listless and just did the bare minimum to get by. there was always this mental fog i had to fight through. i knew i was different, but i believed i was special which was a big mistake. every time only in hindsight did i see how much better i could have done if i could have put in the effort. i was ahead and doing great in school— until i suddenly wasn’t and from there it’s a blur. even if i’m being super productive, i will eventually get bored with the activity and move on. the more effort i put into it, the more resistance i will meet the next time i try to initiate the activity. i like the comparison of add to having a ferrari brain with bicycle brakes. i get depressed when i notice my enthusiasm peaking and motivation dropping off too quickly as if my brain doesn’t have enough juice to get to the finish line— or any finish line ever. i’m bored and i want to quit while my mind refreshes and searches for a new thing to fixate on and obsess about. i’ll probably come back to that other thing later to not do it some more. i can’t direct my attention to the areas of my life that actually need it. i can’t even direct my attention to the things i enjoy that used to distract me from all this— but that’s more depression related. --- at some point in the last year, i had the sobering realization that sitting in front of my computer for over 10 hours every day (which was my normal for the last 10 years) is obviously the largest factor exacerbating my feelings of misery, isolation and poor health while being unsustainable. the thing that brought me safety, comfort and joy in the past is now sapping me of my life force. at some point i went from enjoying my me-time living vicariously through tv show characters and distracting myself— to feeling like i’m just hiding from the world and my stomach goes into a knot thinking about all the loose ends and unresolved stuff hanging there. i’m even a little afraid to go walking around outside in my city for fear of running into someone i know or my ex because he lives in the neighborhood. i don’t want to explain myself to people anymore. life is not about closure though. i just get so stuck on something it consumes me. then i let it go entirely and move on to the next thing. i hide because i don’t know how to cope with my feelings and i don’t trust my judgment anymore and i’m afraid to leave my comfort zone. it doesn’t help that my mother picks up all the slack around the house and i do wish she wouldn’t because it keeps me complacent but she knows i’m depressed so i guess i should appreciate it. she’s always coddled and sheltered me so it’s her second nature to nurture, soothe and take care of her only child. she felt like she had to compensate for my father’s absence but she could never be strict/i didn’t take her seriously so i turned into an entitled self-absorbed know-it-all. now i look at my mom and think she did a good job raising me to be a good child— but parents should raise their children to be good adults. it’s as if i’m missing a key piece of the puzzle for being a regular person and i still act like i did when i was a teenager. as long as i live with my mother, i feel like a kid. i haven’t had a normal routine since a very long time ago. every morning i wake up feeling the dread of uncertainty thinking about how much i’m not going to get done today and how i’m tired of being me. --- when i was 18-20 my plan was to go backpacking through europe right about this time. i imagined i would have a job with a skill that i taught myself and i thought i would grow out of my bad habits and magically acquire willpower one day. my parents never validated my feelings. they ignored my low self-esteem and avoidant behavior to keep emphasizing how normal i am and how i should just relax and be normal. i have dozens of bookmarked guides and resources for a ton of different projects that i’ve wanted to start for years but i’m more skilled at organizing and categorizing things into lists of lists and more lists instead of actually doing them. i don’t follow through. i forget. i get bored. my eyes glaze over and my brain says “next thing! go-go-go now! no time!” even playing video games or activities i used to love— i feel guilty because i know i should be getting my life together but i can’t fight my brain or overcome inertia. i should be advancing my real life self instead of hiding behind an online avatar and peeking over my screen out the window peering and hissing at all the happy people living their lives in ignorance and bliss. i thought i was so mature as a kid and now i feel stunted. in theory, i love to read and learn and i have a curious exploratory mind but when i try to execute something i don’t follow through. “i’ll do it later,” i say about everything but “later” for me is anytime between 1 minute from now and the year 2052. about 10 minutes in— my eyes glaze over and my brain switches to battery-saving mode but i’m still reading the physical words which have lost all meaning before i jump up and run off to do something else. and then i’ll lie. i’ll lie that i did do the thing that i only half-assed. i’ll lie that i did something instead of nothing. i lie to avoid or get out of confrontation or impress or divert the conversation. i cut corners and then lie. in social situations if/when i feel comfortable, i can talk to people like they’re my best friends but once i’ve learned enough about them i get bored and disengage— even subconsciously i’ll just displace the person into my peripheral vision because i need a new source of stimulation. i don’t really think to reach out and call or text first. i let a lot of time pass worrying i’ll be rejected until it’s too late and rejection is inevitable. time is so elusive in my world and i guess people really don’t like to wait. i’ve let many fair-weather friends slip by this way. i wait for others to reach out to me instead of being the initiator because then i feel wanted. probably something to do with fear of rejection. it’s not even a normal organic fear— it’s a conditioned fear and a remnant from my childhood. i always thought i was impermeable to bad influences because i swore to be the opposite of my father and learned what not to do from him, yet here i am— stuck in a similar pattern. scattered, disorganized, frustrated, bored with self-defeating tendencies and all. --- in my mind, all scenarios always end in rejection, disappointment or some negative perceived slight on my part. i pay attention to perceived slights intensely and often in my daily life. pretty much after every interaction, i go over it in my head and think of all the ways i may have offended them and all the reasons they now hate me. i blatantly avoid contact with people and think they don’t notice but they do. the ones that take it personally probably really do end up disliking me because they’re just reacting to my reaction to them. i’m just now realizing life is whatever you make it. if you walk around with a dark cloud over your head all the time, it’s bound to cast a shadow on those around you causing you to internalize their reactions which are just projections of your own insecurities in the first place. if you’re confident and comfortable from the beginning of the interaction, then everyone else feels comfortable to let their guard down and you establish common ground. i can feel the tension in the room when i walk in pretending to be nonchalant, praying that no one addresses me or tries to make small talk— while in the process alienating myself from everyone in the room by creating an almost palpable mental separation of ‘me vs them’. it’s always like that. someone once said i always look like i’m having a bad day. when i get on the defensive, i start looking for things about them as kind of collateral in case of emergency. i do this with everyone. i’ll pick up on something they say and throw it in their face later when we’re arguing about something. for every criticism directed at me— i have ten up my sleeve for them before i start to dissect their personality and get really mean. i realize how manipulative that sounds but these are all defense mechanisms i developed in order to cope with my environment. i’m still acknowledging them and acknowledging just how tightly wound i am. it just doesn’t occur to me that other people are just as alive and stuck in their bodies like me and we have more in common than i like to think but i need to create a separation for some reason. i fall down the rabbit hole and i feel like i’m not ready to face the world, that i’m ugly, that i’m stuck in my cocoon, that it requires this immense exertion to socialize, that i just don’t have ‘it’— and even worse when i’m in a social interaction where i’m made to feel inferior/criticized even a little— i shut down and pull out the superiority card in self-defense. i’ve always wanted to fit in and not be singled out while simultaneously craving being the center of attention which i was with my friends. then i feel bad about being manipulative because i’m not actually a sociopath and i desperately want to connect to people; i just don’t know how to do it correctly. i was raised without many boundaries and not believing in boundaries has gotten me in trouble. i feel like i’m physically exerting myself to act normal around people while they can just let themselves ‘be’ effortlessly. why i’m so ashamed of myself— i don’t know. --- maybe i’ve just normalized so many negative habits and disproportionate reactions while developing brutal defense mechanisms. i always feel hostility in social environments— probably because i always feel vulnerable and social interaction feels like taking a personality test. like in the break room at my old job, i would brace myself before entering the room— heart pounding, palms sweaty— hoping for only a few people. i try to maintain a neutral expression but i’m hyper-aware of all my movements, how my hair is sitting, people standing in my profile and staring at my flaws or if they notice how nervous i am and smile meekly at me like i’m about to pounce on them. if someone asks me a question, i may stutter and then they think i’m an idiot and lower their speaking pace and emphasize important words like i’m a toddler, which just irritates me more. i just can’t let other people see the real me. it’s like i feel obligated to keep it a secret for no reason but it feels like the biggest secret ever. i just have so much needless self-loathing and shame covered behind a thin veneer of false confidence. i feel bad that i have nothing to show for myself after being an adult for 5 years. i know a ton of useless shit but i’ve never produced anything or developed and nurtured an employable skill because i don’t have the discipline/willpower for it.",adhd,0

29e426ea-2a92-4c9f-99bd-a24600cbc300,"a couple of days ago, i posted about the adhd depression loop, and how easy it's to get sucked into it. i did wanna make a small guide on how to get out of it based off my experiences. i am currently escaping that loop and i feel like maybe my insight might be appreciated for first time loopers or in general. 1. **recognize you're in the adhd depression loop:** if you got this far, congratulations. now that you know you're in the loop, you can get out. it sucks to be here, but fortunately, you can escape :d 2. **note that you are talking yourself down:** you will be unnecessarily harsh on yourself for every action you do. whether it is an adhd symptom or not. even if you're mad at yourself for good reason. part of the issue is sometimes, you will write off the actions you do chalking it up to the person you were. you will basically [be like this] ) (it's a clip from bojack horseman). ""wow im a dumbass who can never get his work done."" even if you feel that this is true, you are in dangerous territory of allowing yourself to continue being that person. 3. **come up with ways to stop talking yourself down:** to be honest, i don't know how to get rid of that inner voice. i do have ways to suppress it though. first off, being aware that the internal voice is doing you more harm than good already somewhat diminishes the effects of it. recognize that you aren't that person that the inner voice describes and you are going to be someone better. yeah, adhd gets in the way, and the general predisposition to depressive episodes, but those aren't you. those are obstacles you have jumped over time and time again, and you can do it once more to get what you want. 4. **tell yourself you are great and can get out of this:** it might feel disingenuous. if you have a hard time having an inner voice tell you that you are great, write it down, say it out loud. chances are you have fallen trap to the adhd depression loop before and you have gotten out before. you can definitely do it again. even if you haven't, you're still an amazing creative person that can get out of this rut. 5. **set up small goals:** another way to help is to make your checklists or task list or whatever you do to make sure you are doing work consist of smaller goals. brushing teeth, showering, getting out of bed. when you check those off, you might feel like you have momentum for getting through the rest of the day. even if you don't, the very least you feel is some sense of accomplishment for winning the small battles you face every day. even if you fail those, you aren't destined to be the person you were yesterday. 6. **move onto the bigger goals:** once you said you were amazing a billion times, and finished the smaller goals for a while, start stacking up those task lists with more stuff, and fill your day with things you have to do that you feel you are capable of doing. don't forget to schedule time for yourself and reward yourself for completing the work you set aside. don't be too harsh on yourself when escaping the loop. sometimes the responsibility that we have given ourselves while we were stuck in the loop seems overwhelming, but take it day by day at a time, and one day, maybe we can get out of the loop my friends. also, remember to seek professional help and therapy if you do really feel you need it. there is nothing wrong with therapy, and i find myself in a significantly better mental state when i am consistently going to therapy.",adhd,0

b26378cb-4859-45df-8ef7-cc8d27f4e784,"hey guys, my largest problem in managing my adhd is undoubtedly procrastination. now the annoying bit about procrastination is that it isn't an adhd symptom; it is a type of behaviour you learned to cope with having adhd. so popping meds doesn't solve procrastination, because it isn't a symptom. i've been struggling with it for a very long time, but recently i attempted to approach my tasks in a different way which has really been effective for me. i still have shit days on which i just never get started, but they are becoming less and less common. so to understand this approach and why it works you gotta know that most procrastination stems from perfectionism. i hear you go: i don't have perfectionism, i screw up plenty and i'm lazy as hell. but perfectionism isn't: you actively try to do everything perfectly. it's: nothing is good enought *unless* it is perfect. that creates massive pressure for yourself, and this makes you procrastinate. ok, understanding that, let's move on. the reason i personally procrastinate is because i look at my end point; my assignments, my tasks, my emails - all things that i have to hand in, do, or send to *other people*. it's that i am so hyperfocused on the quality of my result, while i totally forgo any effort of dealing with the process of getting there. not only that, but if you procrastinate like me, your sense of responsibility is heavily geared towards responsibility *towards others*; teachers, employers, et cetera. so everything is external rather than internal. we focus on the goals not the process, and we focus on what we have to do for others rather than what we value ourselves. so as an experiment i tried to switch it around. i tried not to focus on the quality of my goals, but on the process, the minute-to-minute doing-of-work, to determine whether i was doing well. i tried to shift my sense of responsibility towards myself, towards whether i thought i had done all i could; not to what an external authority figure would say. instead of feeling ""i have to""-pressure from others, i would *choose* to get to work. basically, my goal for a day was to feel happy when i looked at how i had spent my time. *not* all the goals i might have completed, although that also helps. just putting in the time. and it really does work. it isn't magic or anything, and of course such a thing as a lasting mental shift is just something that slowly develops, but i've had more good, really productive and stress-free days than i've had in ages trying this. so to sum up my advice: * goal vs process: don't feel good about end results only, focus on puttin' in the work. * responsibility to whom? don't do it for someone else, do it to make yourself proud. * selfworth: let it be determined by time and effort invested, not by whatever finish line you thought up. * choose: this is a cliché but i really think you should never think in terms of ""i have to"". you don't *have* to do anything. you choose to do something. now i think a theme you might notice here is that it all goes from external to internal. it moves from outside to within, both in a social sense and in a temporal sense. from external authority figures we move to responsibility towards yourself. from goals and results far in the future, we move to putting in the work (without feeling the massive pressure of those goals so much!), right here and now. from feeling good only when we hit the finish line and hand in that thing, we feel good by being busy *doing* that thing. that's a bit counter-intuitive. when we think about procrastination, we think: *i* don't want do do that, *i* first want to do some of this. so how can all this centering in on myself and on now be even remotely an antidote to procrastination? i dunno. i think it is because we *think* procrastination is a selfish activity; we choose to do something fun rather than what we *ought* to do, but really, procrastination isn't selfish at all. because at the end of the day you feel like shit about yourself and you'll be underperforming. procrastination isn't selfish; you're hurting yourself. so yeah i dunno. give it a shot maybe. do the work because you want to feel good about yourself at the end of the day, not because you're trying to force yourself to get to work. oh shit i forgot to mention that part, but i'm not gonna revamp this post now. the whole idea of this approach is that you *reward* yourself by thinking ""shit i really put in some time today, go me"". because i usually tried to force myself to get to work: ""if you don't do this shit you'll be in serious trouble!"" that shit doesn't work and it will only make you very very tense. keep it light i guess. good luck to you all. disclaimer: i wrote this post while procrastinating lmao",adhd,0

b4b4e135-506b-4459-841d-b0903be0cde8,"i've been recently diagnosed this month with i-adhd. i've started on 5mg of adderall up 3 times a day experimenting with how it feels when i'm on and off. also, seeing how the third dose of the day affects my sleep. my pyschiatrist wants me to report back what i find. today i've taken an off day, and certainly don't feel like i have the clarity of thought that i do when i'm taking adderall. i also feel super unmotivated despite forcing myself to work on productive things. slowly... and then now i'm here on reddit. anyway, i just had a mild fight during a conversation and when it got more and more negative my mind just shuts down. completely. blank. everything is black/grey in my mind if i could assign a color to it. it's like i'm reaching for responses, and they are in a cloud of uncondensed thoughts. they fail to crystallize. it would be better for me to keep talking through these moments. lately, i've been forcing myself to continue in these moments nonetheless than stopping in the middle of a conversation. i'm often successful in being able to articulate something, but the trade off is what i do say in these moments isn't usually helpful, elegant, or able to turn things around in a conversation that goes badly. it also need not be hard conversations. it's pretty much any communication that requires attention/concentration above the baseline of normal, fun, excited, or relaxed conversation. if something is very technical, and i'm not an expert on it already or that familiar with it, i also struggle. if i'm trying to do anything at all out of my comfort zone, i also struggle to articulate elegant and fluent thoughts. my girlfriend is so good at this. she is always telling me after the fact, i could have said this, or that, or have done xyz. instead, i struggle. i put forth so much effort and have so little to show for this. conversations on the outside seems like i probably am not trying or engaging the other person. inside, i'm racking my brain to come up with anything to say. anything at all. blank. blank. and blank. and what does come out often is not natural or an appropriate response to the situation in terms of how people would normally respond. is this common with people having i-adhd? googling this i came across this: [understanding brain fog in adult concentration deficit disorder (cdd) unfortunately is not well studied, and not part of the dsm (and thus unlikely to be something my psychiatrist would even consider when diagnosing me). so i'm not sure how real it is. i relate to this parts: &gt;brain fog - you know, that feeling that you have cobwebs in your brain; where it is hard to think clearly. you feel like you are walking around in a fog and it takes you a while to process what is going on around you. you might find it difficult to concentrate, but not because you are distracted - it is more because your thoughts simply won’t come together. you might feel like you are moving inside a dream. when you are forced to concentrate, you find it exhausting. some people describe it simply as a “fuzzy” brain. regardless of if cdd is real, does anyone else here relate to what i'm describing? is this part of adhd? what helps you get past this?",adhd,0

82bedcaa-fd93-4ae6-82cd-83cb776ca712,"originally posted this in the narcolepsy forum, but it applies to anyone else who takes adhd medication. also, hi, i don’t ever post here. hello, fellow narcs. i want to inform you of a serious medical condition i developed while being treated for narcolepsy it’s a long story so there’s a tldr at the bottom; *please* read it if you or anyone you know is taking medication for adhd. so. it’s 2017. i am 19 years old, freshly diagnosed with narcolepsy and fairly excited to try xyrem. i’d taken vyvanse for years (for adhd) with no issues, but i really wanted the feeling of a satisfactory, restful night of sleep; the way a normal human does. august 27, 2017, i got my first shipment and started my first week. it was amazing, i could probably write a novel on how different my brain felt when rested. i felt so *normal* and it made me nearly euphoric. everything felt possible and i felt capable again. it started, 7 days in, as a strange tingly pain in my legs one evening while standing in place. an hour later, my knees felt like something had burst inside; there was a sensation like icy water and they were red and swollen. the pain came in several forms: muscle spasms up and down my legs; a crushing, rolling sensation across my kneecaps; severe cramps that inhibited me from standing or walking; and painful muscle stiffness. if i held onto my knee and moved it left to right i felt something grinding that also could be felt by others. i called my mom (crying and panicking) and met up with her for er trip #1. at this point, i wasn’t scared of what was wrong (i consulted the internet and figured i tore or dislocated something), i was scared of how *bad it was going to hurt* when they fixed it and if i could maybe be put under while they moved whatever back in place. so yeah, i was freaking out, feeling sick with pain and trying not to moan every time the wheelchair went over the slightest bump. they did an x-ray and bloodwork. the doctor came in, told me everything was fine, and wrote me a script for pain meds and crutches. i was debilitated over the next few weeks and hospitalized many times as the condition worsened. it was a nightmare. nobody could give me answers despite running every test they could think of; many doctors didn’t believe it was as excruciating as i said it was. it genuinely felt like someone was crushing my kneecaps, going back and forth over them with a steamroller, and stretching and snapping my muscles and tendons, especially my it band. one hospital doctor told me it was psychosomatic and referred me to a therapist. (i am female and was 19-20 at the time.) i stopped taking xyrem because that seemed like the most logical cause. nothing improved. i discontinued vyvanse as well and nothing improved. the pain spread to my upper back, shoulders, and elbows. i saw a physical therapist who noted how swollen my knees were and how atrophied my muscles had become (which makes no sense as i’ve always been fit and it had been less than a month since the condition started at this point.) (a lot happened in between, i wrote the fda a novel just now, haha, but i’ll give you the short version.) after a month or so, i started taking my meds again since nothing got better and i couldn’t find anything online that sounded even remotely close to what i was experiencing. the pain was constant torture and never had any sort of rhythm or predictability about it. i noticed one day i wasn’t urinating much and that my urine was dark. i went to the er and mentioned other symptoms i had assumed were stress: tachycardia (resting hr &amp;gt;160), nausea, vomiting; my legs were puffy and ached. they ran tests, told me i had anemia, (no prior history) and that i was just dehydrated. the iv caused increased muscle pain and i asked the doctor to check my kidney function. he told me i was fine and discharged me; i went home. i thought i was going to die that night. dramatic, i know, but it was that deep sort of primal instinct/feeling that something was *wrong*. i was too afraid to take any medication because i was convinced it had to be meds, despite not having evidence. that was december 2017. after two months of no meds, the mysterious muscle condition seemed to have gotten a bit better. i could walk across my apartment without braces, crutches, the broken swivel chair, or having to sit down. i wasn’t in constant pain and the pain i did experience was nothing compared to how it had been at the peak of it’s severity. like, it was still bad enough i had to chew on ice and go to my mental happy place, but i didn’t fantasize about amputating my legs anymore. i began xyrem again. no problems, the pain stayed consistently manageable and i decided xyrem was safe to keep taking. (it was, thank god.) i still didn’t know what happened to my body. (it still hasn’t gone back to normal, i still experience pain and can’t do as much as i used to. i’m only 22.) so a month ago, my new prescriber wrote me a script for 10 mg vyvanse (for narcolepsy and adhd, i was planning on going back to school, finally). i was a little nervous but figured, okay, it’s literally a pediatric dose. the condition is getting better and was probably some one-time freak medical mystery. within a week of taking vyvanse, i felt it beginning exactly as it had the first time, tingly legs, sore knees, cold sensation. i had a panic attack, felt absolutely sick with terror and grief (i depend on stimulants quite a lot and can’t work or go to school without them) and went back to fervently researching via the internet. and i found it. on this website, the fda website, and a few other ones: it’s called rhabdomyolysis, it’s *extremely* rare, and was only added to the warning label in 2015, which explains why doctors didn’t think of it during my battery of tests and examinations. it applies to all adhd medications, this includes strattera. it is a **life-threatening condition** and if you begin experiencing symptoms, contact your doctor immediately. here is what is published on the site: “rhabdomyolysis is a side effect associated with several different types of medications, which causes muscle fibers to begin to break down, releasing a protein called myoglobin, which can damage the kidneys as they attempt to filter it out of the bloodstream. **symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle cramps, tenderness, stiffness, pain or spasms.** the illness is usually reported in patients over 65 years of age or those who have renal impairment or uncontrolled hypothyroidism, however these drugs are prescribed heavily to children and young adults. over time, rhabdomyolysis can lead to kidney damage and even kidney failure. some may require dialysis or a kidney transplant. the list of drugs that must now carry the rhabdomyolysis warning includes adderall, adderall xr, concerta, daytana, desoxyn, dexedrine, focalin, focalin xr, metadate cd, methylin, quillivant xr, ritalin, ritalin la, ritalin sr, strattera and vyvanse.” **tldr:** for some reason, after starting xyrem, the stimulant i was taking caused a life-threatening condition called rhabdomyolysis. basically, it dissolves your skeletal muscles resulting in a protein being released into your bloodstream. this can cause kidney damage or failure and long term muscle pain/weakness. stimulants can cause muscle cramps, especially if you’re dehydrated, and rhabdomyolysis is extremely rare. you can ask to get tested for it if you think you have symptoms. symptoms: dark, red, or cola-colored urine decreased urine output general weakness muscle stiffness or aching (myalgia) muscle tenderness weakness of the affected muscles other symptoms that may occur with this disease: fatigue joint pain seizures weight gain (unintentional) i’m writing this because back in 2017, i came here looking for answers. i messaged with a few other people who had *the same exact symptoms*. i don’t have my old account anymore, so i can’t check up on them, but i wanted to check up on all of you and bring more attention to this. sorry for the long post; take good care of yourselves, stay vigilant and knowledge about your health and medication. love u",adhd,0

9dbb8fda-a6b3-4533-89e8-9ca1f40bda9e,"i just stumbled across this article on the new york times website. i usually read any article that might provide a hint to why my brain is so dumb, in the hopes of finding hacks to override its self-defeating tendencies. here's what i found. the concept is one i'm acquainted with, but haven't read about for a few years. i think it may have been brought up when i was seeing an executive-functioning coach briefly before i went off to college. so it's not new research, but it might be new to you. the idea is that your brain is programmed to do things that are easy to complete, giving your brain that juicy dopamine hit when you accomplish it. us adhd types probably have a harder time with this. anyway, the result is that our brains prioritize tasks that appear to require immediate attention (such as responding to texts or emails or making a snack or walking the dog) even if they are much less important than something with a farther deadline (like studying for the test 2 days from now). the proposed solution is when you're making a to-do list, to make a table with 2 columns and 2 rows. urgent/not urgent and important/unimportant. put every task in one of the 4 boxes. start by doing the urgent &amp; important things, then the important but not urgent, and finally the urgent but not important. if you still have time (you probably won't) you can do the unimportant and not urgent things. the article can probably explain it better: any thoughts? i feel like this technique might be helpful if i could just make myself do it. i think it's helpful for adhd folks to always have a notebook handy to write things down. tl;dr: your brain is bad at prioritizing and is more likely to order the cat-petting machine that will double in price in 9 minutes and 30 seconds than make dinner for yourself, because why eat at 8pm when the ingredients will be just as fresh at 2 in the morning?",adhd,0

4b8ba3c9-95b5-40f3-b612-843d73dd135c,"i know everyone has bad weeks, and i'm curious: as someone with adhd, how do you motivate yourself through a rough week? how do you prevent yourself from being overwhelmed and what steps do you take to ""reset"" and put yourself back on track? here's a little background of my situation for anyone that wants to know more. i will preface this by saying i am seeing a therapist and have an appointment with my psychiatrist on friday and will discuss all this with her. i am a college student diagnosed this year with adhd-pi and have also struggled the past 4 years with serious depression and anxiety. these past two weeks have been horrible. i haven't been able to focus, to the point where i can't even complete very short assignments, and am falling behind in my classes. because i haven't been doing the work, i feel too anxious to even go to classes because i'm unprepared. i've become unmotivated and depressed. i struggle with hating myself for being unproductive and just feeling like a terrible person in general. i feel like a failure, and i'm worried about having future where i feel happy and successful. i'm currently taking concerta/ritalin (as well as anti-depressants) but i'm not convinced the adhd medication is working. i felt like maybe it was helping, but now i'm not so sure. i've tried adderall and that had no effect on me. from the stories on this subreddit, most people seem to clearly know when their medication works and that hasn't been the case for me. which is disheartening. i just want to be able to concentrate and feel productive and successful at something. i've never felt that way before. i'm seeing my doctor this week so i'll talk to her about the medication. i saw my therapist yesterday which helped a little. but i'm just stuck and overwhelmed right now. i'm feeling too much and it's painful. and i'm frustrated i can't focus, which isn't helping. so i'm wondering how other people with adhd get themselves through a tough period of time. tl;dr: overwhelmed with feeling depressed and unmotivated, and can't concentrate. how do you motivate yourself to get though a bad week, and what do you do to ""reset"" and put yourself back on track? edit: thank you everyone for the support and comments! i really appreciate them, they gave me a lot to think about. i'm confident i'll get through this now!",adhd,0

[i made a post about rejection sensitive dysphoria a few days ago] and basically it means that we are hypersensitive and feel bad easily. so the real question becomes.. are we forgetting the negative because of the positive or the positives because of the negatives? **does doing what we enjoy make us forget the pain (like how morphine dulls our ability to feel pain but its still actually there and we're not feeling it) or is it more that we are like batteries and doing things we like top up the battery and not doing it slowly drains it?**",adhd,0

d23f3c49-fd54-4744-af3c-c4b9fc456c77,"**edit: wow, thanks all for the many amazing and thoughtful responses. i'm still at work/class for a while yet and i haven't had time to go through them all carefully or respond since last night, but you guys have given me a lot to think about and i appreciate the different perspectives. as of now i'm planning to spend more time reading over everything you guys have said and thinking about it. i'm also going to talk to my female roommate m about the situation and her perspective before i take any further action or make a final decision on what my position will be in our group talk. she's back now and he's going to be at dinner with our boss and a collaborator tonight, so i will have time to get her opinion.** sorry for the length, but i just need to get this off my chest. so i'm 28 years old, female, and i'm in graduate school in the biomedical sciences. i work in a lab with a bunch of other students, 2 of whom i also live with. our lab used to be in new england, but last summer we moved to the south. i'll call my roommates c and m. m is a girl that i've lived with for 3y. c is a guy and he moved in with us this year when we moved down. m has known that i have adhd and that i take adderall for it for basically the entire time we've lived together. c found out that i was prescribed adderall for adhd this fall. honestly it was me being careless in my conversation and being honest when he joked about it that led to him finding out. his first reaction was to ask ""can i have some?"" i said no, which i was honestly really proud of me for. i have a hard time saying no to people. i texted him later and told him that i never give or sell my meds, especially after a bad situation in the past (i gave no other details). that was in sept. starting after that i felt like i was noticing that they were going much faster than normal... but i felt extremely guilty for even thinking that. so i moved them around in my room to hide them or tried to keep them in a bag that i kept with me. and it still seemed like they were going really fast, but i never counted. i felt too bad about even suspecting. anyways, i ran out sometime in nov and it took me a little while to try and get a new setup here. i tried going to campus health, but they told me that they didn't have a copy of my official diagnosis/it was out of date, and i needed to go get a $2500 test done before they would be willing to continue my medication. they did give me a 30 day refill to cover me while i got the official testing. but they also spent a lot of time on scare tactics about the dangers of stimulants and it felt like they were all but accusing me of abusing it- although i don't think it was me specific, the impression i got was that campus health was very anti-adderall for anyone, even people with adhd. this was very frustrating for me- they have records of me being on the exact same medication schedule for 10y, and i've been on addderall in general of various forms/doses since 2000. but they need the official ""original"" diagnosis? anyways, i had a serious panic/anxiety attack about it and i decided that i would save this medication for an emergency (like the very intense 6 week summer course i have coming up) and see how i could get by doing normal work without it. the answer to that is that i could barely keep my head above water enough to not get fired in the last 3 months. it makes me feel sad and frustrated and worried, but none of the things i tried to cope were enough to help me maintain a level of focus i need to do my thesis. so i'm taking steps to get the medication down here- i've found the original diagnosis (very hard to do) and i've made an appointment with a gp that is not affiliated with campus health that based on phone convo seems much more willing to work with me. but the point of all this is that i never took any of the meds they gave me in dec. but yesterday i noticed that the paper bag (which was in my dresser drawer in my room) was open. i took out the bottles and counted the pills. over a third were missing. and i know this all happened in the past couple weeks, because i moved the bag then and it had not been opened at that point. i guess my old hiding place had been more effective? i confronted him and he admitted it right away and admitted that he had a problem. apparently he used to do this in undergrad as well but none of his undergrad roommates ever noticed. i've always known he has serious substance abuse issues- he's a medium alcoholic and he also abuses weed. but he was like ""when i saw it i couldn't stop myself"" well i was nice ish at the time, but that's bullshit. he never saw it, he heard about it and then he went through my room and my stuff. and he kept going back, over and over. he checked all the time for months even when he never found it. i told him he has to buy me a safe deposit box and i'll be counting my pills from now on, and i told him that i was telling our other roommate, because she deserves to know since she lives here. from that point the conversation mostly turned into me being sympathetic about how he's an addict, and talking about how it might help him to check out na meetings or other resources on campus. i can already tell that this isn't his ""rock bottom"" though. he was constantly making excuses for himself and trying to downplay how bad it is because he's not serious about making a change. unfortunately i've already signed a lease with him for next year. and i don't exactly hate the guy- we are friends and he clearly has a real mental issue just as much as me. but at the end of the day, i can't let his problems become my problems. we're going to all talk as roommates after m gets home tomorrow, and i've decided to tell him i've decided that when we have a group talk i'm going to reiterate to c how fucked up this is and how there's no excuse. and i'm going to say explicitly that i'm going to forgive him this time but he needs to make it right in so far as that is possible. and i'm going to warn him that from now on i'm counting every pill. i'll probably have a tally on the bottle and a copy of the number on my phone so it can't get messed with. and if this ever happens again, even once, even a year from now, i'm moving out and i'm telling the lab, including our mentor/boss. because i did the math and he's totally out of control, not to mention what an insane fucking violation of privacy it is that he went into my room and went through my dresser on a regular basis. i hope that stops him and i hope that he doesn't get too upset when i say that. because honestly it would totally fuck up his life if i told the boss this. i feel like if i did that he would probably drop out of grad school. but if i warn him about that ahead of time i don't think it's too harsh. because that means if he feels the urge to do it then he needs to get help, because if he ever takes another pill from me then he does it with the full knowledge that he's doing this to his future. i mean idk if it will make any difference in terms of an addict's ability to control their behavior but it makes me feel better than i'm drawing a line in the sand and making a decision now. so if it ever happens again i don't have to decide what to do or feel bad that he made it so long or forgive him based on the extenuating circumstances of the slip up. tl;dr: my roommate has been stealing adderall from me and we have to live together for a while. i think i'm going to forgive him for the past but have a zero tolerance policy in the future",adhd,0
131f7574-e72b-4805-9b40-22340330e1c4,"this past year i worked at a start-up. my co-workers were young, driven and talented. they regularly put in fifty-hour workweeks; our twenty-five year-old ceo regularly put in seventy, he lived for the company. they worked hard, cared about their careers, and it motivated me to do the same. but try as i might, if i worked more than work forty hours a week i’d get burnt out. this made me feel lazy. my co-workers could worker harder than me, and over the long run, they would be better at their jobs. i knew i had the talent to compete with - if not outperform - them, but they would go farther in their career. this was really upsetting, and i blamed my lack of “work ethic.” but then i realized something. i was getting burnt out working long hours because it took time/energy away from my other pursuits. i play ultimate frisbee, i do yoga, and i read. more time and mental energy into work meant less time and mental energy for these other passions. i view all three of those as a “practice,” as something that i’m going to regularly pursue and improve at for the rest of my life. all three can be thought of as “pleasure,” but they all demand discipline and work if you’re going to continue down the path. so in a sense, all three aren’t simply amusement, they can count as “work.” if i count the time doing these practices as “work”, then i’m working upwards of sixty hours a week! that’s a completely different story to tell myself! so, back to my co-workers. they devote fifty-plus hours a week to their career. that is impressive and laudable. but as i slowly realized, that’s all they do. they spend fifty hours a week at the office, maybe they play a rec league sport once a week, and the rest of the time they’re watching tv or hanging out. they outperform me at career, but i’m miles ahead with everything else. this happens in other parts of my life, too. i’m in the top 20% of local ultimate players - and the ones ahead of me typically devote more time to ultimate - but i’m better at yoga than 95% of them. i go to a yoga class and i’m in the top third of the class, but i read more than 95% of them. i go to book events and i don’t read as much as some people, but i’m more physically active than nearly everyone else. this isn’t about telling myself that i’m better than other people, or worse, telling myself i’m better in response to feeling like i’m less than them. it’s recognizing that i’m a generalist competing against specialists. most people are specialists. they have one or two major pursuits. most people in the adhd world are going to be generalists. you’re going to have a broader range of interests than most people. enjoy that, foster that. caveat #1: it is important to pick a few hobbies and stick with them. if you bounce around from pursuit to pursuit every few years - like i did - you’ll never be great at any of them, and you’ll miss out on the path of mastery. i highly, highly recommend reading “mastery” by george leonard. it explains the process of mastery, that plateauing - which is usually when people quit/move on (especially those with adhd) - is a regular part of mastery; stick with it, keep working and you’ll be rewarded. i almost moved on from ultimate two years ago because i had gotten to a new plateau and didn’t see how i’d get much better; but i stuck with it and discovered tons of room for improvement. i’ve continued working and getting better and that’s kept my passion for the sport alive and well. caveat #2: i still play video games and otherwise idle away the time. everyone needs downtime. but i try to limit gaming sessions to about ninety minutes at a time. otherwise i’ll feel that i wasted quality time/effort that could have gone into productive outlets like yoga/ultimate/reading. so, recognize that you’re a generalist where most people are specialists. enjoy that and use it to your advantage. you should still commit yourself to a few hobbies/interests and make them lifelong practices, a journey of mastery. after all, why get one black belt when you can get three?",adhd,0
09d63a65-4d6b-4759-a030-025d2194867d,"(super tl;dr at the bottom if your focus is butt.) is the video in question, and i've written a summary, because, well... you know why. i'd still highly recommend watching the video to support this youtuber, because even though i just discovered her, she seems super awesome and helpful. &amp;nbsp; #**the how and why:** adhd brains need a lot of stimulation, and we end up doing useless things to try and get that dopamine fix our poor little wrung out brains need to function (see: scrolling through social media for three hours). &amp;nbsp; trying to stimulate your brain a lot of the time is like trying to fill a bucket with water, but the bucket has a hole in it. so we spend hours doing something low-energy like the aforementioned infinite social media scroll, and it isn't even really fun to do. or we keep doing the same activity so often it stops being as fun. &amp;nbsp; the solution is doing activities we actually enjoy for stimulation, that fill our buckets up more. but making choices, weighing the options, and then actually figuring out the steps to setting it up and all of that is usually intolerable because we're already bored (aka low on that sweet sweet dopamine). &amp;nbsp; **tl;dr**, executive dysfunction happens because your brain needs the good good dopamine. can't do that without doing a thing to make the dopamine. can't do the thing without the dopamine. cycle of hell. #**the part you actually care about: dopamenus** so to get around this, you can make a menu of activities in advance, so you aren't doing all of the brain-things at once that turns you off from ever doing anything since it's just too much work. basically just a fast-track list of dopamine-making activities. &amp;nbsp; you can categorize it in any way, but, jessica from the video made her menu like this: &amp;nbsp; **step 1:** design your menu. think about things that have made you feel really excited and alive. and on the flipside, your go-tos that don't really give you much. jessica from how to adhd's menu, as an example, looked like this: &amp;nbsp; * entrees: the activities that excite you and make you feel engaged, like yoga, playing an instrument, or walking your dog. the good stuff. * desserts: things that you tend to overdo it on, and don't give you a lot of bang for your buck. these aren't bad to do, but if it's all that you're eating, you're not gonna feel great. scrolling through social media, mindless eating, watching tv, playing video games. * appetizers: short things that give you a quick burst of energy but can't suck you into that black-hole of time. jumping jacks, a cup of coffee, setting a 5-minute timer for social media. * sides: things you can add to other activities to make them more engaging. adding a music playlist, fidget toys, making something more challenging. &amp;nbsp; she also added a special extra menu for what she dubs as 'specials', things you can do occasionally but not often, like concerts, buying a new outfit, or vacation. &amp;nbsp; **step 2:** eliminate options that aren't realistic right now. quarantine is probably going to dunk on a lot of your options, unfortunately, but save those things for later so you don't lose them. things on your 'menu' should be stuff you can actually do right now. &amp;nbsp; **step 3:** prep in advance. set up a work station for your activity, have your sheet music and instrument somewhere accessible, prepare a playlist of yoga videos to follow, you get the idea. basically, decrease the amount of steps as much as you can in advance so that the things you want to do are less painful and daunting, and more in-reach for your dopamine deprived brain. &amp;nbsp; **step 4:** if you'd like, jazz up your menu in any way that makes it fun for you. write a blurb to make some things more tantalizing, put a fun design on it, but the important part is you post it somewhere you can *see* it, on your fridge or wherever. consider making a few mini versions for other places you find yourself, like your desk or coffee table. jessica put a mini-version on her phone's lock screen as well, which is pretty damn smart. #**okay it's done now:** i hope having this in text helps some people. executive function gets me bad, and making small projects that are short enough i can't possibly abandon helps me a lot. i might post my menu in the comments once it's done, feel free to share yours if you do it. &amp;nbsp; **super tl;dr:** make a list of activities that give you dopamine. try to limit the ones that give you a useless tiny hit of dopamine, like social media. set activities up in advance. you now have a short-track list of pre-prepared activities to make dopamine if you're suffering from executive dysfunction. go subscribe to *how to adhd* on youtube.",adhd,0

69e1d046-c47e-4f9d-8d1e-59b8aa015d82,"this is a cool trick i developed but it took me years to realize how to do this. when i was 30 i started burning out from work due to add sort of driving me 100% all the time. i realized that going to the woods and backpacking helped a lot but it wasn't practical to drive 3 hours all the time just to relax. meditation didn't help because the adderall makes your mind unable to break free of the things you're focused on. i would end the day completely exhausted mentally which would sometimes cause me to want a glass of alcohol (which i don't like and is unhealthy). meditation seemed interesting but the ""focus on your breathing"" never worked for me. i realized one day that fishing really helped. then i realized that simply sitting outside really helped as well. so here's the trick #1 do something unrelated to your main work (which you're trying to escape from) which puts your mind in a state of flow. this could be hiking, sewing, working on a puzzle, fishing, etc. this is one strategy if you find it really hard to disconnect. if you work on this for say 20-30 minutes at a time you can really unwind your brain and avoid burnout. here's trick #2. go outside, some place pretty, with birds, nature, etc and focus on the sounds. what i like to do is find a bird in the distance, and just focus on him. really listen to him. this helps out a lot in the morning when the birds are out and singing their morning songs. if you don't have access to this you could try asmr but i think that's less helpful as the sound isn't real. anyway. this really helps me and now i'm able to step outside for some air and meditate when i get burned out and this helps me recover. good luck",adhd,0

5c69796b-c23a-4efe-83e0-fdf9fecfec0b,"so this is my first post here and just want to say this community is awesome. it's nice to be able to read that someone else out there is going through or has gone through the same things as me and reading about how everyone else out there deals with adhd really helps give perspective on my own approach. i've only recently (about 3-4 months or so) started treatment for adhd, and i've learned a lot about myself with both being on and off medication. it's almost like a part of me that's been sleeping for years finally woke up and i can *finally* do all the things i've been too burned out to do! set an actual time and date for a get together with friends or family? *sure*! remember to bring that document to work? *yup*! remember the name of that band i heard a few days ago? *h.e.a.t*! pay my bills on time without autopay? *well*... most things are getting better. one of the most impactful things i've learned from both lurking around on r/adhd and from my doctors, is that adhd can lead to or make depression worse, which can in turn exacerbate symptoms of adhd, which in turn does the same to depression... it can get messy. has gotten messy, at least for me. i initially went in looking for ways to treat adhd and hadn't considered that depression was tied into it all too. i've recently became very aware that adhd adds a good deal of mental and emotional tax on my day-to-day and it can really add up over time. it's something i think that i've always *known* but never really thought about too much. for example, it takes a dedicated mental effort just to focus and do things like homework or pay bills and it takes an emotional toll when i miss deadlines, need to rush to finish things, or when i let others or myself down. this all lead to some unhealthy coping habits like not making definitive plans, not participating in things that require time commitments, not learning people's names, or not emotionally attaching myself to things (like grades, projects and jobs) so that i won't be disappointed if/when i fail. this mental and emotional tax is made worse without adhd treatment and especially so if depression starts to worm its way in, which was absolutely the case for me. i've gotten much better with treatment and with actively practicing good adhd management strategies. i'm far from being where i want to be, but i can actually start to see and feel that i'm getting better to where i'm almost a different person than i used to be without treatment! anyway, i just wanted to share this little personal revelation and victory of mine. i wasn't just suffering from adhd, i was depressed and getting worse in both managing my life and my health. thank you everyone for sharing your stories and your advice! this community has given me a great tool in my mental health toolkit. &amp;#x200b; for those interested, these are some common symptoms of both adhd and depression which can be made worse by either. this is by no means an extensive list, but just some of the ones i've experienced first hand. * disinterest in hobbies, people, self care and especially things that are important, like drinking enough water. * disorganization and problems prioritizing. * problems focusing on tasks or conversations. * forgetfulness - forgetting names, places, events, what i ate this morning and where i put my keys. * anxiety * trouble coping with stress * panic attacks (usually though stress and anxiety) * increased fatigue and sleep problems * irritability * changes in appetite and weight * mood swings * *burnout -* it may be redundant to include this here, but some days this really is the only way to describe the emotional, physical, and mental exhaustion with life in general that popped up now and then. *disclaimer: this is not medical advice.*",adhd,0

66f4d121-a400-470c-a58e-c318c8ce2246,"hi guys, i've been uncluttering a lot recently and it found it helps my chaotic life a lot, so i'm sharing what advice i found best. this isn't a comprehensive guide top-to-bottom everything-you-need-to-know. (there are some links at the bottom for that.) this is some stuff useful for anyone, but mainly focused on our challenges. add some if you have more! :) ### what's harder when you have adhd 1. weaker focus. 2. weaker memory. (""where did i put these keys again?"") 3. weaker decision making. 4. [decison is a thing: it means not only decisions make you tired, but the more you make, the weaker the next ones are. that's why the jobs with many decisions are hard, stresfull and paid like a boss. the less you have to make, the better. 5. i think we are more prone to decision fatigue. ""should i start horseback riding? should i think about this now or try to re-focus on work?"" also, trying to take a decision, postponing it and doing it later counts as 2 decisions. (or 3. or more.) however, it's more shots, but you only get one point. 6. perfectionism. ### how can uncluttering help? 1. **the clutter is talking** to me. ""i'm a wrapper, toss me!"" ""i'm a reciept, file me!"" ""get me home!"" ""don't forget me tomorrow!"". as if i needed more distractions. 2. ""one place for everything"" means **less searching and remembering**. i know where my keys are! :) 3. ""one place for everything"" means **less decisions**. ""where should i put this pasta?"" on the shelf with rice and pasta! :) 4. seeing what you have at a glance means having **less to remember**. ""what should i wear today? with this top go with that skirt in the drawer or that one on the floor? i have nothing to wear!"" perfectly matching skirt was forgotten in the wardrobe. 5. seeing what you have at a glance means having **less shopping**. ""i think i'm running out of conditionnner"". (3 bottles are stashed in the bathroom. true story.) saving money, time, mental energy. 6. less clutter means **less stress** about people coming over, losing things, running out of things, damaging things,... i have enough stress with all the things i fail at already. 7. less clutter means it's **easier to clean**. ""should i clean the kitchen today? but it's sooo much work..."" every 2 days for 2 months. true story. (noticed the 30 decisions that went to waste?) 8. uncluttering helps **overcome perfectionism**. unless you'll make your place spotless (teach me, master!), you'll have to be content with something **""good enough""** or just ""well, at least it's **progress**"". ### some strategies for us adhd-ers 1. set some simple rules so you don't overthink it. for example: ""always start with trash"". (or laundry, because it takes time.) consider following a cleaning schedule: if it's tuesday, i'm cleaning the bathroom. 2. ufyh recommends breaks: 20 min cleaning 10 min break, for example. have a snack, because decision fatigue. 3. ufyh recommends taking pictures to see your progress. i don't remember my room ""before"" well enough to see the improvement, so i can get discouraged easily. enjoy the **progress**. 4. a cool motivational thing is to invite people over. who loves **the thrill of urgent work at the last minute**? we do! 5. konmari recommends working by **category, not location**, and storing things from the same category together. for example: my cookboks live in 2 places, kitchen and living room. ""where should i put this book"" is a decision. ""what cook should i take today"" requires having to remember the other ones, not just looking at this one shelf. one book i had in duplicate. 6. konmari recommends a specific decision process where you do the **whole category**, take everything out, and see thing-by-thing if you want to keep it - the complete opposite of advice like ""toss one thing a day"". let's imagine 50% of your things, you don't actually use. if you just look at the room and search for something to toss, chances are you'll pick 3% of you things and you'll always be living with the remaining 47%. ""my house is always cluttered no matter how hard i try, which scientifically proves i suck."" here's my take on that: - **try it** on an easy category like socks - something **personal**, **not shared**, and with **not too much sentimental attachement**. you'll see if seeing all the socks, touching that sock and seeing if you feel joy for having it makes the deciding easier. - beware of perfectionism here. konmari says her method is perfect and you'll clean once for all - there's a little bit of sales talk here. many people on /r/konmari say they do 2, maybe even 3 iterations. don't shoot for a perfect textbook konmari, rather err on the safe side: it will be huge progress already. you can always discard something later, do a second iteration when you know yourself better etc. - it works, and it changes your shopping habits a lot. it teaches you to only buy things you find supa-dupa-awesome. it ruined the huge shopping during sales for me. :) 7. label the heck out of your boxes, drawers and whatnot. why remember, why think ""what was my sorting system here again???"" when you can just look? 8. you can have friends help you. when konmari says to keep your cleaning secret, she mainly means women and their clothes and moms who try to salvage things. a friend can help is stay focused and make decisions. ### more great advice 1.

7521dff6-a1b5-4600-aa2b-ac52a4422af9,"i've heard people say that people with adhd are just ""overstimulated"" by phones and such, which is bullshit. people with adhd have broken dopamine pathways, so are chemically understimulated from birth. someone who is overstimulated would have something like schizophrenia, as they have way high dopamine levels. when on my phone i don't start having fucking hallucinations and delusions. hyperactivity isn't what people think it is. stimulants don't make someone hyperactive, they have the opposite effect. for a personal example, the first time i took a caffeine pill i was extra mature and did all my work. because hyperactivity is done in *pursuit* of stimulation, to make up for lower dopamine levels or boredom. this is a terrible misconception that results in taking away the controlled stimulation that people with adhd need. **tl;dr - adhd people don't ""bounce off the walls"" when taking stimulants, whatever people may think.**",adhd,0

b81707a7-0b97-438a-91eb-5fd86a5b35b2,"context: 22 years old, unmedicated task initiation. i just... can't do things sometimes. like i literally can't make myself do what i know i need to. i know logically that different parts of my brain didn't develop properly and that my brain as a whole struggles with dopamine regulation and that it isn't my fault that i can't control that with sheer willpower alone. i know that logically. but it feels like nobody else does, and that's the really hard part-- that it feels like nobody ever believes me. there is no good way i've been able to explain this symptom to anyone in a way that makes sense to them. i've only been met with, ""yes you can, try harder. you're just making excuses."" so when i can't do something that will affect other people, i resort to outright lying about why i didn't do it or why i can't be there for something. lazy. flaky. stubborn. i know i'm probably not those things, but it doesn't feel that way when everyone says you are. i once had a girl harass me on facebook for not coming to class enough. she called me names and said terrible things that i know weren't true and that she only said because she didn't know me or understand why i couldn't come to class sometimes. but that was before i had my diagnosis, so part of me believed her because i didn't know why either. in elementary school i had the same gym teacher for all 6 years i went there. she would single me out, pull me aside, and say ""i need to see more effort from you."" over and over. and when she decided i still wasn't trying hard enough, despite having no way to actually measure that, she'd send me to the corner of the gym to practice whatever we were doing that day by myself. growing up, when i told my parents i couldn't go to school or do my homework, i was yelled and sworn at until i complied out of pure anguish. they took that as proof i was lying and could do it on my own if i wanted to. that wasn't true, but that was before my diagnosis so i didn't know otherwise. nobody has ever said the phrase, ""you're just being lazy,"" to me more than my brother. it's carved into my memory and it burns when i ask someone to help me do something because otherwise i know it won't get done. i wish so badly i could just be honest with people and tell them it's my brain, my adhd. but i can't, because then on top of being a failure, they'll think i'm a liar too. especially my parents, but also my friends, the rest of my family, my boss, and my coworkers. before i dropped out of college, my professors and classmates were on that list. **i know i deal with severe imposter syndrome because of these things. i know my near inability to ask for help or even just admit when i'm struggling comes from these things. i'm actively searching for a therapist and a psychiatrist to try to do something about all of this. but right now, at this moment, this is really hard. yet i'm still privileged because if i wasn't blessed with a genuinely supportive boyfriend, good friends, an understanding boss, and financially supportive parents, i don't know what my life would be like right now.**",adhd,0

f66a0a48-a1f9-4fad-ab9c-cec5a9dbb949,"hi everybody! so my story is a little on the long side, but i'm in a bind, and i'm honestly frightened and depressed. about a year ago, everything in my life appeared perfect. i was married, with 2 wonderful sons, living in a 4 bedroom house in a gorgeous and expensive city with a 6-figure career working as a computer engineer. my wife cheated on me, which resulted in our marriage ending. to prove to myself that i could make it as a provider on my own, i left an 'okay job' for what i thought would be a better opportunity. i was failing at my new job, which led me to get treated. the treatment was working, but i failed to improve in time for hr to give a fuck and they canned my ass only 4 months in to my new job. really really disheartening, because i was on an upward swing. i was really improving! vyvanse changed my life for the better! so, things i've learned: 1.) my marriage was horrifyingly co-dependent. my wife literally took care of me. i did not realize how much she did until i did not have her anymore. once i lost this unhealthy coping mechanism the house-of-cards from which i'd built my life started to collapse. 2.) since i've changed careers every 2 years, i don't have the depth of knowledge necessary to find work in this area easily. people don't seem to want a jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none. 3.) i'm behind on all of my bills. i have so much paperwork with unemployment i need to get done. i have debts that i need to get paid. i have divorce papers that i need to deal with. all of this on top of cleaning, eating, and all of that other daily stuff that there isn't enough time for. 4.) i'd be lying if i were to say that depression and anxiety weren't through the roof right now. 5.) oh yeah, and my son went to the er a while back, and i have to figure out how to make my insurance (which i also just lost...) pay for it, because i can not afford the $3000 bill they're charging me for a tube of over the counter cream. 6.) i'm so afraid of appearing as a disappointment and failure that i haven't even told my ex that i lost my job, and i won't be able to keep up child-support or alimony much longer, and that i'll probably have to move, and i'm scared to death of her reaction. i'm scared of everything. it's been almost a month that i've kept up this ruse, and i know that every day i don't tell her will only make things worse, but that only makes me even more afraid of telling her this absolutely critical information. i'd rather fucking put a bullet in my skull than feel her wrath (this is hyperbole, i plan on living, but seriously... ugh.) there's a lot more to the story i guess, but these are the important parts. i just want to run. i don't know how, or where, or what to do. i've got a few pills i'm reserving for emergencies, but without insurance or income i can not afford treatment, therapy or medicinally. i'm extremely unhappy. i do not know who or how to ask for the help i need, but i need a lot of help. i'm a 35 year old man, who has never learned how to be an adult. my façade has crumbled. i'm at complete rock bottom. what do? addendum: the thing that pisses me off about all of this is that i'm not sugar coating things when i say i'm brilliant and intelligent. i know a lot about a lot of things, i just suck real bad at execution and follow-through. this makes it even more difficult.",adhd,0

b9f62bef-09a0-48ed-b383-3d8e2a71bba3,"i’m on a phased return to work, after being off for over a year. i hadn’t been diagnosed with adhd and the uncontrolled symptoms were making it very difficult for me to stay in work. my depression and anxiety were in overdrive. a year of therapy, daily doses of elvanse and a whole lot of self-reflection, i’m up to around 20 hours a week, 6 months into my return. it’s very hard not to beat myself up. my partner is always so proud of me after a good day or good week in work. he tells me i’m amazing and inspirational. i always felt like he was patronising me and i couldn’t be proud of myself. i couldn’t accept the praise. i challenged him on it, saying i didn’t understand why he was so proud when he works full time and it’s so easy. he pointed out that my brain makes it very difficult me to do a lot of the things neurotypical people do easily on a daily basis. i’ve had to overcome a lot of obstacles most people never even consider. the fact that i’ve fought so hard and am still fighting is something to be proud of. a year ago, i couldn’t even leave the house most days. all the steps required to leave were just too overwhelming. now i’m in work most days, showered, wearing clean clothes, even makeup! i’m productive, enjoying my work and feeling positive about the future. i still struggle to be proud of myself, but i’m getting better. i have so much to be proud of and so do you. did you manage to go shower this morning? awesome. made a home cooked meal? you rock. lay in bed all day to rest? well done for looking after yourself. comparing ourselves to neurotypicals all the time will only make us feel like failures, more overwhelmed and less hopeful. we face so much more than most every day and we’re still here. be proud.",adhd,0
a23bac29-75e3-4545-a083-9fe9d4d6e697,"**important update** i was surprised some people didn't believe that brand and generic stimulants can be very different. i provided proof at bottom of my post. i drop $300/month on brand name adderall xr for a reason. its patented delivery system makes generic adderall xr a huge joke. sorry, i just assumed others knew this. hopefully it helps some of you, who go to a pharmacy, and all of a sudden get a different generic med, which sucks really bad. it's not you. it's the manufacturers' formulation. you can fight insurance to get approved for brand name. **start of tl;dr** (1) try out a bunch of different adhd meds. don't just stop at the first one that works. (2) brand name drugs can affect you differently than their generic versions. (3) different generics of the same drug can affect you differently. (4) if you have high blood pressure, there are meds that can help, and some can also help with adhd symptoms. (5) antidepressants can help with adhd symptoms. (6) anxiety meds can greatly help with adhd symptoms. (7) in case you need it, some basic sleep aide drug info listed below. (8) try using a big yoga ball instead of a chair, when you study at your desk. (9) have some kind of buzzer box go off ever 15min or so, to keep you from daydreaming, or getting sidetracked. (10) try out binaural music. (11) many with adhd do a lot better when taking notes with pencil &amp;amp; paper vs typing on computer (12) if you put your textbooks and notes on your eink ereader, you can walk around town, all day, studying. (13) if you take your meds, then sit at your desk, and look at pictures and figures in your textbook. you will then have a better chance of reading your textbook, when the drugs kick in vs waiting for the meds to kick in before opening the textbook. (14) talking to yourself is common with adhd, and helps. talking out loud, as you read your textbook, also helps. (15) you can use dry erase markers on normal glass. every window in your house is a potential ""white board."" (16) don't get stuck in the very common and shitty adhd trap of typing a paragraph, then doing a bunch of editing, then typing another paragraph, then bunch of editing ... on and on. try to type up your entire rough draft before you start editing. (17) use text-to-speech software to listen to your report read to you, while you close your eyes. ms office has a ""speak"" function. (18) if you can workout daily, great. be careful about pushing yourself to do it earlier than you naturally wake up. for some, it has a chance of backfiring, making adhd symptoms slightly worse, though it will still make your body healthier. **end of tl;dr** if you're insane, and want to read all the details, because you love super long, boring posts, then keep reading ... you sick bastard ;-) **try each drug class** try short supplies of each adhd drug class. ex = methylphenidates are amazing for some, while amphetamines are amazing for others. note = success with strattera is a long shot. but, i can say that intuniv or wellbutrin, taken alone, is a joke. they only help as additions to methylphenidates and amphetamines. note = if your doctor is making you keep taking a drug that doesn't really do much, and refuses to let you try others ... their self interests are more important than your medical care. **try different meds in each drug class** ex = adderall works well for some, while dexedrine works well for others. **try the brand name and different generics** why, you ask? because, there is a huge problem with adhd meds - it's very common for one generic to work well, while another makes you sick. ex = sandoz manufactured adderall makes some people dizzy and nauseated, while barr manufactured adderall works very well, and vice versa. how is this possible, you ask? first, each manufacturer has their own secret synthesis processes &amp;amp; delivery systems. second, the inactive ingredients ( binders and fillers ) are different. this often makes a difference. ex = concerta. the brand name mfg uses their secret ""oros"" delivery system. generic mfg actavis uses an osmotic pressure delivery system. generic mfg kremers uses a bead delivery system. **blood pressure** keep track of your bp. if it's high, talk to your doctor about meds that treat it, like intuniv or propranolol. **antidepressants** for some individuals, adding an antidepressant, like lexapro or wellbutrin, can help with adhd symptoms. **anxiety drugs** anxiety makes adhd symptoms worse. lexapro and wellbutrin can also treat anxiety. help with adhd symptoms. buspirone is also an anxiety med, but you should read the success rate, before you put your faith in it. the holy grail of anxiety meds are benzodiazepines ""benzos."" common ones are klonopin and xanax. if anxiety is affecting you, especially if stimulant meds make it worse, i recommend taking a benzos drug with your stimulant med. it's a pretty sweet feeling. note: it's risky to take benzos on a regular basis. google ""benzos withdrawal,"" and you'll get an idea. **sleep aides** otc meds, like melatonin and benadryl ( active ingredient in zzzquil ) do a decent job. prescription sleep aides, like trazodone and ambien often do a better job. often, though, benzos drugs work even better for people that take stimulant meds. keep in mind, it's very risky to take sleep meds on a daily basis. **yoga ball chair** if you have at least an okay balance, try a large yoga ball, instead of a chair. being able to constantly wiggle around on the ball makes it easier to sit and work at your desk. **repeat buzzers** download a buzzing app on your phone, or buy a device, like the ""motivaider."" you set a time, such as 15 minutes, and it will vibrate every 15 minutes, over and over. my brain constantly pulls me into daydreaming, but every time the buzzer goes off, it snaps me back to reality. **binaural music** you have to use headphones, which have to be able to play a different sound in the left vs right ear. play binaural music, while studying. this is a hit or miss. works for some; drives others nuts. ex = **pencil and paper** try to take notes with pencil and paper. often makes memorizing things a lot easier than typing. **ereaders and walking** purchase an eink-only ereader, like the kindle paperwhite. they're very light, cheap, readable in sunlight, and you can't do much besides read on them. download textbooks onto it, and read, while you stroll along a 3-hour circuit throughout your town. you can also download your notes onto it. if you do handwritten notes, you can scan or save pics of them as pdfs, and put those on your ereader. **half-ass method** easiest way to explain is by example. you need to read chapter 4 of your textbook. take your stimulant med. then, open and stare at random pages in the textbook, look at interesting pictures/figures in it ... just keep staring at things in the textbook. eventually, you will realize the drug kicked in, and you've already read a few pages, and are taking notes. this technique has its limits, but it has served me well. **talking to yourself** this is a common thing individuals with adhd do. reading out loud uses this natural trait of ours, and makes it easier to understand and memorize information. **glass and dry erase markers** glass surfaces can be used as dry-erase boards. easily wipes clean. only use regular glass - don't use fiberglass, etc. i have a big 6'x3' piece of glass against my wall, which i write all over. i also sometimes write on my windows. my whole house is a big sticky note. **writing and editing reports** finish writing your rough draft, before you start editing it. individuals with adhd, especially while on stimulants, often get pulled into writing a paragraph ... then editing and rearranging a lot of the paper ... then writing another paragraph ... then editing and rearranging a lot of the paper ... on and on. this becomes a huge, inefficient time sink. **text-to-speech** after each draft is complete, have a text-to-speech program read it out loud to you. close your eyes while you listen. ms office has a ""speak"" function built in. **workouts** one of the most beneficial things to do ... and one of the hardest. but, of course, everyone knows this. what i can say is try to workout in the morning. try not to force yourself to wake up earlier than your natural wakeup time, though. doing so appears to backfire on many of us. a large portion of young adults are naturally ""night owls."" a large portion of individuals with adhd are also ""night owls."" combine the two, and many do better by working out in the afternoon, or early evening. **that's all. peace out** **bonus: research summary verification** below is the article explaining why generic non-oros formulation concerta is a joke compared to the brand name concerta, which uses their patented oros formulation. the delivery system in the brand name drug destroyed the generic delivery system, even though they had the same amount of active ingredient in their pills. **i'll try to get another post together tomorrow, explaining this.**",adhd,0

9f64c792-995f-44a5-bed3-85bf5b9b68b9,"something i see a lot of psychiatrists talking about is how adhders lump the entirety of the future into one big, homogenous mess, and that's pretty much true. however, as a coping method they always suggest setting specific times and deadlines for doing specific things. it's almost as if they think we just say ""i'll do it later,"" and stop thinking right there. as an adhder who has always lived within a very structured environment, i think they kinda miss the mark here. if you give me a list of things to do and a calendar, i can (and often do) lay out a schedule without any problems. the problems happen when i try to actually do the things that are on the schedule. all of the sudden it will be hours or days later and it's time to do x or y, and i am 100% not prepared. it's not that i can't set deadlines, or that i don't know they're there. it's that i can't feel them coming. i could (and have) literally do nothing but watch a timer count down the hours until i am supposed to be somewhere, the whole way acknowledging how much time i would have to get there were i to leave right away. *i still wind up late*. to psychiatrists, doctors, professors, and even fucking adhd skill coaches, this just looks like i never bother to set an alarm or use a calendar, so i get the same tired suggestions time and time again. to anyone with an ounce of compassion, the problem is obviously a bit more complicated.",adhd,0

(why?) * despite having a list of things to clean and their priorities, i feel compelled to not do it/goof off.

02e3b50b-2d0d-45c5-93b7-1de88b622e3d,"tl;dr our son with extreme adhd just got all star student of the week at school! i just had to share, because i know how many parents out there are struggling with adhd and feeling hopeless like us. our two kids are adopted through foster care (biological siblings), and our oldest son (8 years old) has struggled with severe adhd. we've done everything short of meds, as we are (were) very anti-medication. and i do mean everything: neuropsych evaluations, play therapy, occupational therapy, other types of therapy/counselling, etc. we're talking thousands of dollars we've paid out of our own pocket trying to find him the help he needs. when we had the neuropsych evaluation, the doctor who administered said he was in the bottom 5% of adhd cases. she said she normally doesn't advise meds, but in his case, there was no question he needed meds to deal with this. anyway, after dealing with some of the most extreme things, such as stealing and lying, we decided to pull the trigger on meds. this has been a 3 month process as we've had to try different meds, and actually dealt with an uptick in the impulsivity, which resulted in even more stealing and more apologizing to parents of friends and awkward moments. as of now, our son is on prozac and extended release guanfacine, and is just wrapping up his second week on the guanfacine. and if i had to summarize how it is going... it has been amazing!!! i know there's no such thing as a miracle cure, but at least his little mind is slowing down, he's thinking things through, and his teacher just acknowledged him as an all star student (a special honor given to one student in the school, where they announce his/her name over the speaker for having a great week or doing something great). she followed that up by telling us that he's had the best week ever, and that he's a different kid, staying focused, not having the behavioral issues, and doing what is asked. we have noticed the same behaviors at home, from throwing the baseball in the back yard (he used to cry or throw his glove if he missed too many) to picking on his sister, to following directions and listening. i can't tell you how proud i am of him. i'm holding back tears as i type this, because i know just how hard it's been for him, through no fault of his own, because of the deadbeat bio parents that didn't do shit for him and probably facilitated the problems he's dealing with today. i hope this is the beginning of a transformation in his life, but i know things can change on a dime. my perspective on mental health has changed, i now realize it's not a stigma, but a very sad reality of our society with children who become adults and suffer from mental illness because of the environment they were raised in. i am realizing how many people are left to rot because they aren't given a chance. i'm realizing in some cases, it's just too extreme to expect someone to snap out of it. i like to think that we're really good parents who are extremely concerned about our kids being productive, contributing, self-sufficient members of society... but no amount of parenting could have fixed this. anyway, i hope this finds someone who is dealing with the issues we have dealt with, and that they can find some hope. we have felt hopeless for years, thinking that our son was on a trajectory that could keep him from having the life he deserves. no kid should have to deal with the crap he dealt with for the first 2 years of his life. as his dad, all i've ever wanted was to give him a chance. for the first time in the 6 years we've been his parents, i feel like he has that chance now.",adhd,0

a727c09f-49de-43f6-a07e-831b6f3c4e96,"hi i just posted this comment on another post but thought it would be helpful for anyone out there dealing with stolen meds. as an fyi i have adhd but more importantly i’m a pharmacy tech and have worked in nc and now in dc. for anyone who has there meds stolen, make sure you file a police report immediately or as soon as you realize! the reason i say this is we will ask to see the police report before filling a script for controls (adderall, vyvanse, xanax...) and put a note in the file. (also helpful for the doctors office.) that way if you ever are traveling and need meds early it won’t look like a pattern of you trying to get an early fill. sometimes we say no unless you have a police report and conformation from the doctor. also most the time we can call and get an override from the insurance so that you don’t have to pay out of pocket! i say most the time because some insurances don’t “care” what the reason is, but i have also gotten a supervisor to override that. it helps when the pharmacy calls and says they have the police report (we might copy it and attach to the script also.) also don’t just go to a different pharmacy because you are worried your normal one won’t fill it, we have a national database for controls that we can see if you filled somewhere else, date, medication, dose, amount, type of insurance and dr who wrote it. the doctors can also see this website! another note for those who have to pay out of pocket (not really vyvanse, that shit is expensive no matter what) go to goodrx and put in the medication name, dose, amount, and sometimes tablet/capsule(mainly fluoxetine) and you can get a huge discount!! this sucks if it happens to you and the feelings of violation, anxiety, and depression are normal (i’ve dealt with break in’s before.) and to lose your medication only makes it worse because you might find it even harder to concentrate on what you have to do. hopefully this will help someone out there!! *be nice to your pharmacist and pharm techs we want to help you",adhd,0

6d72afae-8127-4369-945c-dae362f37904,"[30 essential ideas every parent needs to know (about *sorry about the formatting here. i just did a quick copy/paste from word.* *for the parts of this that sound like there’s not hope or you can’t change anything – most of this talk is using the baseline of no treatment/no meds. that is, if you do nothing, then don’t expect a change.* 1. part 1 a. adhd is a developmental disability. it’s age inappropriate behavior, not abnormal behavior. it’s a delay of a normal trait. by early 30s’, these traits level off for the normal personal, but the adhd person will always be behind. **without help/meds,** the adhd person is 30% behind their age on average. (10 real age = 7 executive age, 18 = 12, 21 = 14, 30 = 20) b. first deficit is inappropriate inhibition. not suppressing behaviors (motor and verbal), but it’s also not suppressing emotions, snap anger, impatience, quick decision making, not delaying to consider consequences. c. the real problem is not restlessness, it’s lack of inhibition in mind, thoughts and emotions. emotion dysregulation is part of this disorder. it’s not a side effect. d. from 1700’s to 1976, emotions were a part of the adhd definition, but the dsm removed it and that was a mistake, because quickness to anger, having low frustration tolerance, easily excitable, impulsive is a key part of adhd. and to display emotions much quicker than most people do. e. the feeling your having is normal. it’s that you’re not moderating it that’s not normal. inability to self-sooth and self-calm so you can be more socially acceptable. because the emotional issues are the real social problem. you can’t be physically impulsive and not emotionally impulsive too. they are linked; they go together. f. the behaviors will be forgiven by friends in a social situation (restlessness, forgetful, arriving late, awkward), but they won’t forgive your anger, hostility and quickness to emote because that’s personally offensive. and that’s the biggest tragedy. inability to make and keep close friendships is key problem and it’s due to the mood component of adhd. also explains job and marriage issues – distractibility doesn’t kill these – the emotion does. g. adhd causes oppositional defiant disorder. because the adhd emotional problems come first and that can lead to odd (not always). half the traits of odd are found in adhd and are mood related: anger, temper, hostility, easily annoyed and irritability. when you treat adhd, you get a reduction in mood problems too. there are still learned social conflict behaviors that need to be unlearned. 2. part 2: failing to develop on schedule a. attention deficit is the wrong name. other things can cause attention problems, so need to be more precise. what is nature of inattentiveness? adhd is distinct. b. it’s a failure of persistence to a goal. a problem with behavior, motivation and the future. it’s a problem with the motor part of the brain – can you sustain action going forward in time. c. resist distraction is also a motor issue. it’s not that you perceive distractions more than others, it’s that you respond to then more that others. it’s an inhibitory failure not a perceptual difference. adhd person is compelled to react. distraction provokes response and response cannot be inhibited. d. working memory disorder also exists. once you get past distraction do you remember to go back to what you were doing. holding in mind the what and when of what you were doing. it’s what you lose when you get old. you don’t have a bad memory – you have a bad working memory. like walking into a room and forgetting what you were after. if you can’t hold the goal and steps in your mind, you won’t be able to get back to what you were doing. it’s gone… just forgotten. so anything else will be picked up. e. three interacting executive function issues: persistence toward the future, resistance of distraction along the way and working memory. this is what sets adhd apart from all other issues that also have attention issues, like autism, learning disabilities, depression… 3. adhd is a disorder of self-regulation, not attention. attention should not have been used as a name. it’s misleading. should have been srdd: self regulatory development disorder a. knowing this explains the why. b. self-control: consciously inhibit behavior and then engage in series of self-directed actions. c. the adhd person has to be able to ask, “why would i work to change my behavior for some future goal? they don’t stop and think about delayed reward and consequences. it’s about what’s happening now, and they don’t have the forward projection in time to see the connection between action today and reward or penalty in the future. this is what causes them to be so far behind other kids who have developed this ability to create self-motivation from an unseen future goal or penalty. 4. how normal self control develops a. self-control is not learned. it’s not about how good your parents were, how you were raised. it’s largely genetic and part of who you are. it’s neurogenetic, neurobiological. b. inability to direct behavior toward yourself comes from inability in these 5 executive abilities. they can be enhanced by training, but they don’t originate in the beginning by training in the social environment. c. these are the 5 deficits that are present in adhd i. can you stop and wait? the waiting is the hard part. the adhd brain is about event-response-event-response. not event --- wait--- response. ii. mental imagery: they cannot visualize the relevant past. do you have recent experiences that would tell you what to do in this instance? they are not looking forward either with visual imagery. lack of hindsight and foresight are different sides of the same coin: applying the past to now, or extending now into the future. “they don’t have the mind’s eye” iii. can’t talk to themselves. internalizing speech and that voice tells you what to do. younger kids talk out loud and that becomes private self-talk. “ they don’t have the mind’s voice” this is why they can’t do what you tell them to do. can’t follow instructions, rules, can’t internalize rules of the situation because that all requires the voice in your head and they don’t have that. iv. the mind’s heart: manage emotion to meet goals and not conflict with them. our emotions are our motivations. if you can’t manage emotions, you can manage motivations. self-motivation is the fuel tank for everything – they can’t motivate themselves internally. so all motivation has to come from the external world. the environment around you and its immediate consequences will determine how hard and how long you can work. if there are no consequences, you won’t get the work done. this is why they can play video games for hours and not do 5 minutes of homework. the video game has instant and continuous consequences for not interacting with it and moving it forward. when a problem is solved on a piece of paper, nothing happens. if you put this person in a work environment without immediate consequences, the work will not get done. it’s not a choice, or willful or the lack of knowing how to do something. they know what to do and know that they are not doing it. they cannot do it without internal self-control and motivation. v. the mind’s playground – the ability to plan and problem solve. the ability to plan and problem solve. the ability to internally simulate multiple future options is the highest executive function in humans. it originates in problem solving and thinking quickly in your mind about multiple possibilities. adhd people have these 5 abilities, but they are weak and delayed. 5. adhd people don’t have a subjective sense of time because they don’t look forward and backward. they live in the moment. · adhd has all the skills and knowledge needed and all that every other kid has (back of the brain), but lack the performance ability (front brain) to use them**.** **it’s a disorder of doing what you know, not a disorder of knowing what to do.** · stop teaching skills. they already know what to do. the problem is at the point of performance. all treatment must be at the point of performance. if the intervention is not done at the natural points in the environment where the performance problem occurs, then it will not help. · talking or helping in the kitchen will have no impact (at all), on performance later in the living room. · it’s not information deficit disorder, it’s performance deficit disorder. · adhd person is disabled because of the delay to get to the consequence, not the consequence itself. increase accountability, increase frequency, immediacy and intensity of consequences/rewards. the problem is with the delay and in this life anything that is important has a delayed consequence, so that causes problems throughout life. · behavioral treatment not teaching – introduce artificial consequences into the natural environment to increase your accountability. improve motivation to show what you know. · behavior modification is instructional, but here more importantly it’s for motivational value, so you have to use it in life for as long as you have adhd. the need for it will not go away. · “how long do i have to do this? when will he internalize it and not need it anymore?” answer: do it forever, he will not internalize it. if you put a wheelchair ramp on your building for the handicapped person, you don’t say “after 30 days of successfully using this ramp, we’re confident that it can be removed, and you’ll be fine.” the ramp is a prosthesis. no amount of ramp will take the need for the ramp away. this is like adhd. · at point of performance – the caregivers and the compassion of the people helping are the most important thing. need people who are invested. · adhd is like diabetes – a chronic disorder that is managed, not cured and the goal is to prevent the secondary problems (amputation), or in adhd lack of friends, lost jobs, etc) managing and accommodating adhd managing the environment 1) don’t make them stop and hold things in their mind. use external, physical form of info. signs, reminders, postit notes, lists… need a substitute for working memory. your working memory needs to be replaced with something external that is in your visual field. a paper journal in your pocket with a pen is welded to your body. this is your working memory journal is better than electronic. 2) you have no internal clock. for anything that involves time, you need an external clock, beeping watches, vibrating things. any stimulus that will create a sense of time. be addicted to timers and calendars 3) you cannot see the future coming at you. if you have something due in weeks, you will break that down into the smallest possible steps so the event is as close to the response as possible. accommodations for more time is wrong. you cannot organize into the future, so the accommodation needs to be to break assignment into small steps, each with a consequence. break the future into pieces. ero: event coming at you, response you take and outcome. if these are kept close together, you don’t need the frontal lobe future visualization. keep it like a video game. college accommodations: more accountability, more hand-holding, more reporting to student services, more curriculum materials, study in groups with older and more competent students, substance free dorm, accountable to someone 4 times per day for what you do. suited to executive level, not numeric age. 2nd half of talk · untreated adhd – don’t go there. long-term treatment is needed. these cross all parts of life. o education/job problems o driving (distraction). all forms of driving stats. adhd drivers must be medicated. o managing money. impulsive person without foresight and has credit card. o social problems – sustaining long-term relationships o sexuality – issues related to impulsiveness. adhd is best predictor or teen pregnancy. every treatment plan needs these 4 components · good evaluation from expert (young age) · family needs to be expert (we are) · like it or not, medication is the most effective tool. should start with it first, not last. you can be there all the time as a parent. meds will be there working when you can’t be there. · make accommodations. create external devices to help them show what they know what can you do as a parent? three roles: · become a scientific parent expert · be and experimenter. try, revise, try, revise until you find what works (meds and behavioral mods) become very skeptical. don’t trust single sources and stuff too good to be true. · become executive parent. own it. advocate for it. don’t wait for silver bullet. make it a part of who you are – just a part, not all of who you are. find the other things that you are good at that can compensate for it. dig in. **read: 7 habits of highly effective families.** photocopy the diagram in the back with the 7 principles and tape it to your bathroom mirror. · you do not get to design your children. you have some influence, but they are largely who they are at a very young age. once you hit the minimum that everyone needs, not additional input will add. if some is good, then a ton must be better is a unique north american perspective. · you child is born with more than 400 psychological traits that will emerge as they mature, and they have nothing to do with you. they are not a blank slate. they are a genetic mosaic of your extended family. you are not an engineer, you are a shepard. free yourself from that guilt, you don’t get to design them. · most powerful influence is where you live (out of home influence). second is genetics, third is parenting · what they know can always increase, but their traits – who they are is influenced most by parents when kids are &lt;7yrs old. by 15 it’s 6% influence, by 21 parent influence is 0. · no correlation between any trait of an adopted child and the parent that adopted them. · you didn’t cause the adhd. you don’t get blame or credit. be more consistent with rules and consequences this is not information deficit disorder, so stop taking and nagging. act, don’t yack. the more you talk the less influence you have. stop thinking that one more sentence will make the diffence and they will finally listen or get it. they will not respond to what you say, they will respond to immediate consequences. get their attention: touch is easy and powerful. look in their eye and keep it short and sweet. back it up with consequence/reward. increase frequency of consequence. break work into small pieces. don’t try to extend it. doing work and taking exams will be done in small chunks with frequent breaks. not one chunk all at once. giving someone who has no sense of time, more time to do a long activity is just stupid. it’s the wrong accommodation. the accommodation should be “time off the clock” you get the same amount of time as anyone else. start a stopwatch start the test. you can stop work and the timer whenever you want to walk around and take a break. when you start the test, you start the clock. in the end you were doing the test for the same amount of time as everyone else. you will only get the same hour as everyone else, but you get to break it up as often as you like. this is how to ask for extra time. but it’s not the same as getting extra time added to the end like what is usually asked for. this is a more compelling way to ask for extra time. when you make a change in activities during the day: 1) make a clean stop. don’t let one activity blend into the next. plan the transition. 2) set down 2-3 key rules 3) establish the incentive/reward. 4) what’s the punishment for not doing it. make it obvious. 5) distribute reward throughout the task 6) after, invite them to self-evaluate how it went. medication: only 1/5 to 1/3 respond enough to behavioral to not need meds at some point. best book: straight talk about psychaiatric medication for children by wellins. amphetamines and methylphenidate are the only two stimulants delivery systems are where the improvements are being made. these drugs are studied and are safe down to age 2. non-stimulant stratera good alternative when a stimulant isn’t good. antihypertensives (if you have odd or other behaviors) 5 ps of delivery systems 1) pill (immediate release) 2) pump (conserta capsule pumps out meds during day best for afternoon problems) 3) pellet (time release coatings. best for morning problems) 4) patch. easy to take, but in about 15% can cause rash 5) pro-drug. vyvanse. drug is combined with other element that is broken off in body. 12 hr drug mythbusting stimulants are not addictive, don’t cause aggression, don’t cause seizures or reduce threshold, don’t cause tics or turrets unless you already have it. won’t lead to later abuse in adulthood. don’t improve academic achievement except over long term. they improve productivity, not knowledge. they make you available for learning. avoid treatments that don’t work well, or have low chance of helping: · elimination diet. removing things from diet. doesn’t work. · no diet supplement, omega 3, vitamins, etc. does not work. · sensory integration training. does not work. · play therapy doesn’t work. adhd does not come from environmental stress · self control training. talking yourself through tasks does work for adults, but only when you’re on meds too. · social skills training. focus on performance, not knowledge 25-30% of adhd kids have adhd parents. so these parents need the same help final thought: the most important thing families in this situation can do is lean forgiveness. everyone will make mistakes and everyone will know how to push other’s buttons. it’s not that you made a mistake, it’s what you are going to do to improve for tomorrow. you’re not engineering kids, you’re a shepard. enjoy tending to them. you can’t turn a sheep into a dog. you can give the sheep a good pasture. you don’t have as much power to mold as you think. it’s easy to resent them if you have an idea that they are doing this intentionally. at the end of the day, write down the problems you had that day. then burn that paper. let it go. after your child falls asleep, go watch them sleep. it’s peaceful and renewing. whatever it takes to let go of each day’s pains and start the next day without carrying it over. forgive. forgive, forgive.",adhd,0

1e3accc2-0bf9-4fe9-bb91-ba2349c7e51a,"my daughter has been struggling with school since at least 2nd grade. mainly grades and lack of focus. i didn't think anything of it, as i tend to tune out if i'm not interested in something. in 4th grade, her teachers tried to get her in special education, stating that she can come up with the correct answers, but it takes her so long. 5th grade, her teachers would mention that she had a tendency to zone out. adhd never once crossed my mind. this year, my daughter started 6th grade, which is also the first year of middle school. wow! and the symptoms came out in full force. they were always there, but i didn't see it until this past year. she is so forgetful, so messy, hard to find/keep friends, very emotional, and terrible grades (mainly from not turning homework in). we also spend hours each night (no distractions in the room) trying to get homework done and studying. this year has been a complete nightmare! i finally put all the symptoms together and realized that it was possibly adhd. after a visit to the pediatrician with forms from my daughter's teachers, she was given the diagnoses for the inattentive type. my ex-husband was adamant against putting her on meds. everytime i would explain what was going on or that he should contact her pediatrician or teachers to hear everything for himself, he would say she needs to come live with him where he can give her the structure she needs. he refuses to research it or ask anyone questions about it. after the diagnoses, i spent lots of time explaining it to my daughter, watching youtube videos about adhd with her, finding celebrities, etc, just tryingto help her understand that she's not different, not dumb, others have it, and that with a few changes we can help make life better for her. since my ex did not want her on medication, i tried my hardest to help her in other ways. different methods of doing homework and studying. i sit next to her the entire time she is working. avoiding yellow 5. she's now on a 504 plan (which my ex didn't want her on because he didn't want her labeled ). notes left on her school laptop. a list written out of all her schoolwork that needs to be finished that day. places for all of her items in her room to live. and i wouldbe happy for any other suggestions! all these have helped a teeny bit, but not enough to get her where she needs to be in life. i'm still receiving notices from school about failing grades and missing papers. she is still an emotional roller coaster. and she still can't remember to take her lunch to school or put things away. i've decided that we really need to try medication so she can stop working so hard to not get very far. it's so sad to watch her struggle through things and know that she is not understanding why. my ex has convinced her that she does not have adhd and she does not need to be on any medication. how can i tell her that she does without it sounding like he is wrong? it's important to me that i always sound very neutral about him and not negative. at the same time, i want her to understand that this medication is much needed and will open new and amazing doors for her. sorry if this is all over the place. i was trying to give as much background as possible, but i can also be long winded sometimes :-) and while i'm on here, i'm open to advice on things i can tell her that will help her be more comfortable with the diagnoses. and other ideas on helping her with school work and daily life. thanks!",adhd,0

2dfaa334-f8fc-4ecd-9768-fe15c7947697,"this is a way i can trick myself into doing that thing i need to do. before you try this, note how the boundary line between different activities is not really a line at all. normally when we have decided we are ""doing"" some new task, actually we are still in the process of moving towards the actual action, or are focused on it mentally. so, when you can't get your ass off the couch to do the chore, just stop whatever you may be doing and close your eyes for a moment. feel your surroundings for a moment, in a sort of mindful way. notice that because starting a task is basically an abstraction, and won't change anything in the external environment at first, having begun the task will actually feel just as relaxing and easy as what you are doing now, except your immediate goals will have changed somewhat. now, since ""actually being started"" on the thing is just a convenient abstraction, tell yourself that you actually are already in the process of doing this task. rather than going through some mental event of ""getting started"", simply recategorize the current moment from ""before beginning"" to ""after beginning"". if we think of the aversion to getting started on something as a sort of mental barrier, then for me this trick is doesn't spend energy breaking through the wall like kool aid man. that takes a lot of mental energy. rather, it's more like closing your eyes on one side of the intact wall, and opening them to find you are on the other side of the wall.",adhd,0

(my daughter's bestie is in the next classroom over and apparently she's had her own run ins with the potty police). i suggested that she doesn't even notice she needs to until her body is quiet and calm. that maybe if he suggested she take a trip right before rest time, she'll have a chance to notice then. ""they have access to the restroom the whole time they're playing outside"" - yeah, and she's not doing it because she's \*busy playing\* - i should point out, she has recently started kindergarten and had her free time severely curtailed - you're betting she's going to spend some of her precious free time in going to the bathroom? you will lose that bet every time. &amp;#x200b; he also talked about the fact that she often ignores him when he tries to get her attention. he does eventually get her attention and she's not, like, running around the classroom and not listening - she's just focused on what she's doing. and i said, ""does it look like hyper-focus?"" and he says ""what's that?"" is it totally absurd that public kindergarten teachers have enough cursory understanding of a developmental disorder which has an estimated prevalence of about 11% (roughly 2 in his classroom \*every year\*)? dude. if i was in a classroom, i could clock a kid with asd, adhd, specific language impairment, sensory processing disorders, hearing impairment, or poor eyesight in roughly a day. (not the same as diagnosis, but definitely flag them for further evaluation). &amp;#x200b; now, i actually think my daughter is 6 and hates to leave things unfinished and thinks that she can get away with getting ""just one more thing"" on her picture if she pretends not to hear the teacher and is completely neurotypical, but her mom has adhd-i and it's hereditary, so i'm on the look out. and inattentiveness would explain both complaints. &amp;#x200b; in a weird twist, he asked me how i got evaluated because he suspects he has adhd as well. &amp;#x200b; i'm constantly shocked with how incurious so much of the world is.",adhd,0

if i had just been born in the hunter\-gatherer society, i would be revered, but because i am born in this day and age, i am not worthy. while this might be true, i am pretty sure that i would have been killed by a bear with how ""in my own head"" i can be. the sad part? i started to believe you. i started to believe that i was entitled to people adapting around my limitations. i started to believe that i needed to accept that i would never really achieve anything because i didn't have the attention span nor the ability to do anything meaningful. then you made me feel like i didn't belong. now, this next part is on me: i stopped sharing my experiences with you. i didn't see the point in telling you about how i almost offended a client by blurting something out that was very inappropriate. or how i forgot my cell phone on a plane. or even how i put my assigned work laptop on the concrete next to the driver side door while packing up the rental car. i was leaving the clients site after a long week and trying to make my flight. in my haste, i drove off. meaning, yes, i left a $3,000 laptop on a curb in a parking lot and flew back home halfway across the world. yeah... the bosses weren't so understanding on that one. i didn't feel the need to share, because i figured out with the support of my family how to mitigate that. and honestly? i'm still embarrassed. but i would still read posts on organizational techniques, because that is still something i have trouble with. i don't know if you were trying to get a rise out of me, i don't know if you were in a dark place yourself, but on one such organization post, you told me that although i technically might have adhd because i forget things, people with *real* adhd have issues with prioritization and motivation, not working memory, and if this helps me, it's because i don't actually have adhd, or my adhd is so mild it is inconsequential. you then quoted dr. barkley about how people with adhd are not stupid, and that we should stop treating them as if they were. i was upset, but i thought that this was perhaps a one\-time thing. i learned it was not. i started coming around with another account, and mostly lurked. that is when your dark side really became apparent. people complaining and not taking responsibility for their actions or expecting other to fix their messes, people invalidating my or other people's experiences whenever whenever someone dared to contradict, or offer a suggestion. people putting other people down, or even telling them that they didn't belong on this sub because the could not possibly have adhd. at what point did this become a contest about who has it worse? why do we feel like we feel like we have the right to judge and tear each other down, especially here? now, most of us are not like this, but unfortunately, it's the ones you wish you could forget that you remember the most. the truth is. maybe you are who you've always been. maybe i am the one who changed. i then realized something: i am confident in my diagnosis. i am confident that my psychologist, my psychiatrist and my family have it right. also: despite what you were saying, i know that although that adhd is a part of me, **i am so much more than just someone with adhd.** i am an intellectual, and i love gaining knowledge. even before i was diagnosed with adhd, i would read at least two books a month. i am a creator, and i love bringing new ideas and insights to light using data. i am a loving wife who regularly makes her husband laugh after a long day. i am an adventure\-lover who loves taking off into the wild for a weekend with friends. i am a mother to a fur\-baby who acts as if her world revolves around me, because it does. i am a data scientist \- a dream you said there is now way i would ever achieve because it would require too much focus. and yes, i am also someone with adhd. i will be damned if i let you define who i am, or how i should be. i am me. and i am awesome. just like you. c",adhd,0

""have you ever considered that you may have adhd?"" talk about a pride check. the psychologist and i spent a whole session going over some of the research in how the disorder can evolve as you grow up, and how it's one of the most treatable mental health disorders. my eyes were opened after a couple of sessions - but i was skeptical. then i found this subreddit and it hit me: i wasn't alone. i agreed to therapy + medication. started medication on a saturday, never having taken medication for anything in my life (beyond antibiotics, etc.). by the end of the day, i was nearly in joyful tears. i had two large-ish social events that day. i was able to listen, and have awesome conversations - i even remembered a couple of book recommendations! i got my housecleaning done with minimal interruption. i had dinner with my family, and i while i acknowledged the chewing noises, it didn't bother me one bit - i just moved on. so here i am - two months later after diagnosis and medications. i take weekends off if i feel like it and don't have to work, but i can honestly say it's been the best decision i've ever made. i'm not out of the woods with my anxieties and depression, self-image issues, and codependency. my family doesn't know, and that conversation stresses me out. but for the first time, i'm on a path, and i'm making measured progress. anyways - if you made it this far or just scrolled down - my encouragement to you is to seek help if you haven't and have the slightest feeling that you may have adhd. and when you do, be skeptical. challenge your therapist - be honest with them. they are the expert, but you are the client. love you all! thank you for reading :) my pm is open.",adhd,0

""because adhd... thats the thing i am here to get tested for."" *sigh* i know this sounds waaay too stereotypical and cartoony... but its literally just what happened... oh and while talking to the receptionists scatter around a bunch of ""uh what?"" thus having them repeat their uh what they said due to me munching on these sweet-tarts because they had a bunch of candy on the receptionist desks. &gt;tl;dr i go to my school's student health services to get tested for adhd. i forget and already lost and lose everything essential to getting tested for adhd... my struggles ensues. okay im going to go find my wallet today. i still have homework to do also.",adhd,0

(i work in av so i get a lot of notebooks from companies that leave them behind after meetings). i also didn’t like that they were all lined and not bulleted or with grid sheets. after months of arguing with myself i was like, “fine, i will just go a buy a bullet journal for the purpose of being a bullet journal.” that journal has been sitting on my desk for a few days now because i now have so much anxiety about screwing up even starting it. such as labeling the spreads for the “index” or “future log”. “what if my hand writing sucks all of a sudden. one crooked letter is going to bug me every time i open the notebook.” i would also like to get into doodling because that is another great thing that i’ve seen adhders do and i feel like i would enjoy it but what am i going doodle on? i know i’m not an artist and it doesn’t need to look good or anything but i still put myself down before ever starting by overwhelming myself with “what are you even going to draw? try drawing something and you yourself wont even know what it is”. this kind of thinking is what causes probably half of my procrastinations and can be quite paralyzing when i am trying to do something to benefit myself. i know a lot of it stems from my broken self-esteem (thanks society!). i have made a lot of progress on that and accepting and loving myself but this is a hurdle that i can’t seem to gain an edge on. i know “it doesn’t need to be perfect” and that is should “just do it”. i can tell myself that all i want but when it comes down to actually doing it i freeze up. any advice or tricks?",adhd,0

e620784a-e562-4d31-a8f9-93227a707148,"i don’t think anxiety ever goes away. at least, for me it doesn’t. maybe there are some #blessed people out there who have figured out a magical way to defeat their anxiety once and for all. but for most of us, there’s no cure. there’s no mountain you climb, or bridge you cross, so that you can get to the other side where you’ll be free from worry and fear. it’s more about learning to deal with anxiety when it comes, and learning to treasure those beautiful moments in time where it’s temporarily absent. a life plagued by anxiety is one of racing heartbeats and fast breathing. your shoulders often feel heavy and sometimes you’re almost sure that you can see a dark cloud hanging over you. there’s a strange fear that doesn’t seem to stem from anything specific. it’s just fear. it’s just there. sometimes you can’t enjoy a nice, peaceful train ride. or a trip to the movies with your friends. because the minute you sit down, you’re forced to be with your own thoughts. they start running around in all different directions. you’re thinking of possible dangerous scenarios, or things that have caused you anxiety in the past. or you just feel scared for no reason at all. it just happens, and you wish it wouldn’t. it’s worse in the winter. so much worse. the days are short and the weather is cold. it seems like it’s always dark. the small amount of sunlight we experience during the day doesn’t even feel like sunlight. it just feels like a strange and brief phase of the day that will be over quickly. darkness will descend in no time. this is when it’s the hardest. when everyone feels cold and bitter and cranky and cooped up. we can’t distract ourselves with light breezes and bright colors. we can’t walk around outside for hours and free ourselves from our own heads. it’s winter. everything is dead and gray and muted and cold. this is when your state of mind and your way of thinking can either make you or break you. you have to acknowledge that you probably will not defeat anxiety. you don’t need to focus all of your energy on “fixing yourself” or finding a cure. stop making yourself feel like there’s something wrong with you. stop making yourself feel ashamed of your anxiety. stop being frustrated with yourself. just because you can’t beat anxiety doesn’t mean you’re letting it win. yes, you’re probably going to have to deal with it for the rest of your life. not all the time, of course. sometimes you will have incredibly wonderful periods of time where you don’t have any anxiety. you can go days without it. you can go months without it. sometimes you will go years before you have to deal with it again. but often, regardless of how long it’s been, anxiety will find its way back to you. you do not have control over the cure, but the beautiful part is that you do have control over how you handle it. the most important thing you have to work on is your state of mind. when anxiety starts to take over, it’s tempting to give in to your thoughts. to let yourself crumble under the fear and the worry and the terror. what you have to remember is that you’re not alone. you are not by yourself. you may feel like you are the only person in the world to ever feel like a prisoner inside their own mind, but you are not. there are so many others who have been where you’ve been, but they eventually got free. not free from anxiety, necessarily, but free from the dark way of thinking that anxiety can cause. a lot of people struggle from anxiety. not everyone, but enough people to show you that there are others who have gotten through this, just like you will. you’re struggling now. you’re terrified now. you feel alone now. you’re telling yourself it will be okay. you’re telling yourself you will get through this. you’re telling yourself you will be stronger when you come out on the other side. but you have a hard time believing it. that’s okay. as long as you’re trying to believe it, as long as you are wanting to believe it, those thoughts will carry you through the darker moments. and eventually, they will start to make sense. they will start to seem possibly true. a lot of people will give you a lot of different advice on how to deal with anxiety. some of it will work for you, and some of it won’t. some of the things that do work for you will not work for your friend or your coworker. everyone is different. everyone’s mind is different. so everyone will deal with anxiety a different way. here’s what you need to remember: there’s a lot of advice floating out there about dealing with anxiety because so many people have had to deal with it. so when you’re feeling ashamed or frustrated or exhausted or embarrassed about your anxiety, just remind yourself that you are normal. you are not a freak. you are not the only person in the world that has ever been this terrified. a lot of us are fighting it. a lot of us are scared. a lot of us have had bad nights that we didn’t think were ever going to end, just like you have. you are human. which means you will get through it, just like so many other people have. you will not defeat it forever. but you will learn how to be okay – and more importantly, how to be happy – in spite of it.",anxiety,1

1ca7885f-0865-4c58-a8b7-3b59c33bc1bb,"this is a crosspost from r/healthanxiety, hope it helps someone disclaimer: *i am not a medical professional or psychologist. i am an academic researcher in an irrelevant area and i used my research skills to find out how to beat anxiety. what i discuss below is just my personal experiences and may not work for everyone. apologies if my english is not that good, i am not a native speaker. * i feel that this sub needs a bit of optimism and a break from reassurance seeking so here is my experience with health anxiety. since i was 21, i would visit different types of doctors a few times a year worrying i had various super rare terminal diseases that i learned from google. the worse of it was back in 2012 when i was 100% sure that i had a rare disease and could not sleep for three months, before a neurologist ruled this out. i stopped being anxious about my health then, however for the next 2 years, i became anxious for many different things which could probably diagnose me with gad, ocd, social anxiety, depression and many other anxiety-related disorders. after some point and after being locked in a dark room for several days feeling miserable, i decided to react and try to get rid of my anxiety. i knew i was very good at googling. after all i was able to find a super rare case of a super rare disease in a forum from 10 years ago, would not be able to find a solution to my only real problem? below is what worked for me. the first step was to realise why i had health anxiety. that was easy, i was probably anxious about my health because i lost a very close relative when i was 11. the second step was to identify when my health anxiety episodes were taken place. checking my records of doctor visits, i could see that my health anxiety manifests after a stressful period in my personal or working life. the stressful period would cause some psychosomatic symptoms and would trigger my health anxiety. another trigger would be something i heard about someone dying or getting sick or reading about a rare illness. i was also feeling more anxious in the evenings, weekends or holidays as then i would have more time to be obsessed with my undiagnosed illness that affected 1 in a billion. the first two steps set the ground for my recovery as it made me look in myself and helped me identify what strategies worked best. the third step in my recovery was to realise that there is nothing special about health anxiety. my view is that health anxiety as well as every type of anxiety are the same: excessive adrenaline that causes irrational thinking and psychosomatic symptoms. all these anxiety symptoms can be explained easily, but as they are so many, i would rather not cover them all to keep it as short as possible, as our anxious minds are impatient too :). this was such a relief for me as i would not have to deal with all these different anxiety labels, but i would just focus on just resolving my anxiety. a definition of anxiety that really helped me when i had anxious thoughts was that “anxiety causes you to give a much higher probability of something bad happening.” this could be a rare disease or catching the deadly germ from not washing your hands every 5 minutes. this helped me identify what my recovered self would be like: when i had an irrationally anxious thought about something bad happening, i would think that the probability of this happening is extremely low and then i would simply not care as most people in this earth. easier said that done, i know. but i got to this state eventually after a lot of trial and error, practice and patience. this is what worked for me: - a hugely eye opener resource for me is the following link that i cannot recommend enough: i read this several times as it is huge and it is difficult to grasp at first. i think it is better than every other anxiety book i have ever read. i followed most of the recommendations and show great results quickly. - i also made an invisible contract with myself that i will stop googling for diseases, stop asking for reassurance (as the excellent pinned post indicates) and stop caring about my symptoms. every time i had a symptom or an anxious thought, i would do nothing about it. nothing at all and would get on with my life. if most people would not care about a silly thought that does not mean anything, why should i care? thoughts are just thoughts, they do not represent reality, so who cares? guess what! the more i did that, the less anxious thoughts and symptoms i had. - i would keep myself busy doing things not matter how i felt. i would read books, watch movies, doing all the tasks in my job while ignoring my feelings. i would pretend that i do not care no matter how i felt. i would fake it till i make it. the more i did that, the more i was telling to my mind that i do not care and the less my anxiety was over time. - i would be patient and would not expect to recover overnight. i had many setbacks that my anxious thoughts came back. i am prepared to have a setback anytime, but i do not care. as i see them, setbacks are an excellent opportunity to practice my strategies. the more i practiced my strategies, the less setbacks i had. the last one was 1 and a half years ago and lasted for a day. - finally, two proven strategies that have worked since the beginning of time is exercise and meditation. especially with exercise i started seeing benefits right away. meditation made me better realise when a worrying thought was rational or irrational. i fully understand that the above are not simple. yes, it took me time and practice. in the beginning, i believed that i would never recover. but once i started seeing benefits, i committed myself. and here i am today, a typical person enjoying his life, his time with family and friends and his hobbies. so this is my personal story and this is what worked for me. as i said this is not medical or professional advice, it is just my experience. but through my research oo anxiety, i believe that anybody can recover. feel free to ask any questions and sorry again for my english.",anxiety,1

49b2ebd0-a38f-4494-bbbd-60bb9e5bcc2c,"i know this is long and i don't know if a lot of people will read this but i really just want to help. i had 2 panic attacks over the end of february and first day of march. i went to the doctor and had my blood work done, ekg, everything and they said i'm perfectly healthy. i workout 6 times a week. i had nothing to panic about! after that day, i started developing harm ocd/intrusive thoughts about the recent news events that's been going on. it made me miserable, hopeless, and sometimes i would feel like ""what's the point?"" i wasn't depressed but i felt derealization. and then i went on to do cbt on my own, went to a therapist, and i realized i felt better but i would still get anxiety attacks. my anxiety kept jumping off to something else after solving one problem. so i kept searching for a cure which led me to learn more about diet, magnesium, and vitamins. magnesium - 70% of americans are magnesium deficient and i deprived myself even more when i was trying to lose weight. i started taking magnesium (magnesium citrate is better, i just started those yesterday) and it made me stop stressing about unnecessary things and obsessing about negative thoughts! i slept better at night and my body stopped twitching a lot. i stopped getting anxiety attacks throughout the day and would only get them maybe 30 mins each day now but i'd move on. i suggest taking 250 mg a day. check the magnesium deficiency symptoms cause this may solve your problems. diet - your body needs a minimum amount of carbs, fats, and protein to function. all this plays a role in your mood. these macronutrients are also important in developing serotonin and transferring them to your brain. serotonin can be developed naturally, as long as you track your diet. i suggest myfitness pal app. track the amount of grams of protein, carbs, and fat that you are taking daily. at least meet the minimum. your brain needs this to function properly! vitamins - so many of us are deprived of important vitamins. take multivitamins and fish oil. the fish oil with omega 3 have helped reduce my irritation and i feel less mood swings! there have been less instances where i felt derealization and not motivated. i started taking all these supplements and tracking my diet sunday and i haven't felt it since! i used to feel it every day. i still get anxiety attacks here and there but it's gone down to like 10%. it was at 60% a week ago. and i heard from people that it never came back even years after as long as they made sure they ate healthy, exercised, and made sure to take time off from stress. it also takes your body a long time to get your deficiencies back up to normal level and will most likely take around 3 months. so be patient. for people who has had anxiety or depression their whole life, it may be that your body just isn't as efficient when it comes to absorbing these nutrients. i know this isn't the cure for everybody but i hope this can help others. there's ton of videos and articles about this online. friends who had anxiety were real life examples for me as they got out of it. i just don't want anyone to go through anxiety, it sucks and feels like hell. if i can help even 1 person feel better, it'd make me really happy. doctors don't even ask us about our diet. neither do most therapists. that's because they don't know about nutrition. they don't study wellness. this was an explanation by a doctor from ucla (forgot his name) as to why we never got blood work done in out nutrients. doctors study medicine so that's what they prescribe. cbt helped a lot for me and i think it has to be a mix of all therapy, exercise, healthy diet, and remembering to take time off stress that can help you manage anxiety. man this is long af lol, shoutout if you read this whole thing.",anxiety,1

c14664d7-5468-4930-afec-992b8c7de203,"i always make so many negative posts about my anxiety and depression but aside from that all, i do have a success story. i was a shy kid growing up, my parents often let me get away with avoiding things i didn't like. in my teens i decided school was too stressful and i started taking days off, before long it became a fear to go. my parents eventually home schooled me and i lost any friends i had made. suddenly i was stuck in the house too afraid to leave, i was pale and unhappy and my only social interactions were online forums and world of warcraft. at 18 i applied for university, absolutely traumatic! i went in and then left as soon as class was over and went home to hide away in bed. just before i graduated university, my father died in front of me. i completely isolated myself after this, uni was over and i had no reason to leave the house anymore. i would spend weeks laying in bed, i couldn't even leave the house to attend his funeral. i was a mess. i left the house just to go to the doctors for anti depressants and anxiety medication but even that was a traumatic experience and i would get taxis everywhere to avoid buses. one year later and i just couldn't live like this. my birthday was spent alone in my room surfing the net. my online forum friends said happy birthday and i had a card from my mother but that was it. it didn't matter how many cards or wishes i had, it was the fact that this was me. alone. (i forgot to mention that from the ages of 13-22, all the time i spent at home, i was using to teach myself to become a digital artist. and i got good in my late teens . i was able to sell stuff from home to keep me going financially.) at 22 i saw a job position. it was a digital artist in a company abroad, this meant a 3 hour plane flight. keep in mind i had never been on a plane before. i applied out of sheer frustration one night thinking i'd never hear back and then stayed up all night playing wow and went to bed at 6am as usual. when i woke up that afternoon i had an email from the company... they wanted to interview me on skype and then if that went well they would fly me over to have a face to face interview. well, i panicked. this was a way out but it was also way out of my comfort zone. even the skype interview was something that kept me awake all night. long story short, i ended up getting flown all the way to them. getting on a plane the first time alone was awful, i was sat next to an old couple and i told them i was scared out of desperation looking for any comfort. i remember ordering sick bags on amazon because i thought i would be sick. i even tried to convince myself the plane would crash and that i should just not go. but i went. and i got the job. i've been there a few years now and i got a boyfriend, people i consider friends (but no close friends), and a nice apartment all from doing something i love. i'm still very depressed and anxious in social situations and people do think i'm weird sometimes because i come across as nervous but my god, if someone like me can make such a big move in life - anyone can. i was an absolute disaster. and my past still haunts me (as mentioned in other posts, not having fun memories of my teens or anything to show for it). tl;dr i was a depressed anxious hermit mess and i applied for a job abroad and got it and now i'm still a depressed mess, but i'm doing a lot better. anyone have similar experience?",anxiety,1

9f50ea59-49f6-4055-aca5-c9f20fe5b18c,"for most of my life i've felt nervous. i overthink everything, i'm socially anxious. but lately there have been physiological symptoms, mostly tension in my body resulting in a lot of back and neck cracking, shortness of breath, irregular sleep patterns, and increased heart rate, especially after drinking. the other night i drank four beers, napped for an hour, and when i woke up i realized i couldn't go back to sleep because my heart was beating fast. my brother said he gets this too. also, intrusive, repetitive thoughts are becoming common for me. then i think about how this must mean i have an anxiety disorder. then i worry about having an anxiety disorder. it's a never ending cycle. another weird thing, i love music, but songs get stuck in my head and repeat ad nauseum constantly in the absence of external stimuli. does anyone else get this? i always thought this happened for everyone, but i don't think it does. it's like my mind is never quiet. it's either always worrying, talking to itself, or playing a song ad nauseum. i think it's time for me to see a professional and maybe get some medication.",anxiety,1

(i live in the south where it's currently in the high 80s temperature wide). a week had passed and i wouldn't let my boyfriend come over because it was so hot. on thursday, it had been a week since my ac broke, i came home and my apartment was cool. i texted my boyfriend (the only other person with a key) and asked what happened. he taught himself to fix air conditioning units in 3 days, came over after work and fixed it before i got home. i was speechless. i cried for about an hour because i was so thankful. i've never had anyone be this understanding. i've never really had a healthy relationship before him. just the fact that he would do this because he knew how i was suffering made me feel the best i have in months. i'm currently cleaning my apartment for the first time in months because i feel calmer than i have in a long time. anyway, i just want to let you all know that our anxiety doesn't have to prevent us from finding love. they are few and far between, but there are people who will understand and lift you up rather than brush you off or think you're ""crazy"" for being anxious about every day things.",anxiety,1

eadd8326-71c0-4536-9114-c532cafdfa26,"for the past 5 years i've been working very hard on my anxiety... i used to be so bad that just about everything would cause anxiety, but now, i barely have any.... i've written down a short list of things that i've learnt in the hopes they would help others. i welcome any feedback and additions to the list!the first step to getting in control of your anxiety, is to fully accept that you can make a massive difference. if you don’t accept this, you’ll be telling yourself things like “this will never work” or “it’s just who i am”. if you believe those things, you won’t make progress. you have to own the anxiety first. it’s yours and yours alone, and that means it’s also yours to discard. you have to get our of your own way… you are the only obstacle stopping yourself from being a better person.anxiety is not a personality trail like shyness or introversion. that’s what i used to think. i thought that because i was sensitive, it meant that i was also anxious…. they are connected, because it’s the sensitivity that made me create strong coping mechanisms in the first place, but they are not a package; one triggers the other.anxiety is all about strong routines. strong paths and habits that your brain follows. thoughts are easily triggered - hyper sensitive, and thoughts trigger the chemicals that make you feel so terrible. the smallest shot of adrenaline can make you think, oh fuck, here we go, i’m going to feel sooo stupid in front of my work colleagues and pretty soon your own body is full of negative and terrible chemicals until you can’t think straight anymore. sound familiar? 😊 the trick is to keep working on your thoughts. at first nothing will change, but as you slowly build new routines by repetition, you will begin to create new paths and new triggers, and more and more and more the anxiety will go away.here are the discoveries and tricks that have changed my life: 1. here is am important bio-hack…. the anxiety we feel was probably laid down as a child due to strong emotions. when you are young, even small things can be interpreted as big things. strong emotion etches strong grooves in our brain. those grooves can be smoothed over with repetition, and if you have strong feelings and passion about wanting to change yourself for the better, this will help to make new grooves also. strong emotion leads to faster changes. 2. next, you need to talk away the layers of self hate that distract you from working on yourself productively. understand that you are anxious for very good reason, and that anxiety used to help you stay safe. accept and love that part of yourself as it did it’s job well, and now it’s time to move on. in fact, flip your emotion on it’s head - say to yourself “you’re awesome for being anxious right now, you sure did a great job saving me in the past”. don’t allow hate towards yourself. break the pattern. 3. choose your language carefully. there is a big difference between saying to yourself “i’m anxious about seeing my friends tomorrow” and “i’m curious to see my friends tomorrow”. you have the choice to choose the words that you use, and the words you use will change how you think. **what you think is how you experience life.** at first a little voice in your head might say “whatever, i just changed my sentence into something i don’t believe”…. but keep doing it and soon you start to see it work. analyse everything you say and think. if it’s negative, especially when it’s negative without any good reason, discard that word, and use a different one its place. get your family and close friends involved too - they are probably really tired of words you use to describe yourself or situations and can help you choose different ones. 4. stay in the moment. always ask yourself “is what i’m anxious about actually happening right now?”. if it isn’t, accept that it’s possible but don’t dwell on it. tell yourself you will deal with it if it happens and move on to a new thought. realise that “preparing” for almost anything negative is pointless.. it just makes you expect the worst. bad things happen rarely, so if you are going to prepare yourself for something, choose to think about how great it will be. remember, everything is a choice, and even highly anxious people don’t choose to think about how much they are going to hate dessert when it comes out after dinner. 5. involve those that are close to you and that you trust: tell them what you are doing and get them to keep you on track. also get them to celebrate with you. when we make changes, they feel slow and often insignificant to us, but they can actually be massive over time. get your friends to help remind you of just how much you have grown and changed. it helps to hear it from them and it helps to keep you going. 6. practice mindfulness.... in it’s essence, this is practicing acknowledging a thought, and then letting it go. it sounds silly, but sometimes it’s better not to try and ignore something. the more you try not to think about pink elephants, the more you do... so rather than actively trying to reject negative and anxious thoughts, acknowledge them “i recognise that i am thinking that my whole day is ruined because i spilled my coffee”, and then allow them to have no further energy in your life. just let them go. no more stories, no fall-out effect. once you have done that a lot, you’ll then be able to correct yourself. the previous statement might turn to “but i also recognise that spilling my coffee is something i can easily deal with and it doesn’t mean anything”. 7. understand that nothing has meaning other than the meaning that we assign to it. what people do, what happens to you, what responses you have, don’t have any meaning - they are just facts, until you assign a meaning to them. so rather assign negative meanings to things, replace them with neutral or positive meanings. 8. understand the chemical processes that sit behind anxiety. we feel so terrible because of the chemicals in our body. when we first get that jolt of energy, it’s just there to get us to pay attention. if we keep telling ourselves stories of how bad things could be, more and more and more chemicals are released to the point where we can’t even cope anymore. that’s what a panic attack is. what people often don’t know is that all this is natural.... the chemicals are there to tell us if there is something unresolved that we need to pay attention to. so how do you stop it? you stop it by making a decision. it’s that easy! you could decide that you will worry about that later. that often helps to deescalate right away. you could decide that there is nothing wrong at the moment, so i you won’t give it any more energy. you could decide that nothing will happen badly. the key is making a firm decision. once you make it, the chemicals will slowly start to leave your body. once you get good at it, you’ll feel normal again in minutes. 9. ask yourself better questions: don’t ask yourself “why is my day so terrible”. ask yourself “how can i make my day better”. don’t ask yourself: “why is my friend not calling me”. ask yourself “what can i do for my friend that will make her feel great”. don’t ask yourself “why am i so anxious”. ask yourself “what can i do right now to help me be less anxious”. you see, the questions you ask determine the answers your brain searches for. if you ask questions to which there is no positive answer, all you will get is negative answers... they don’t help. they just feed the anxiety. when you ask questions that you can only get positive answers from, you will get positive answers. 10. take massive action: when you are in a place where you are feeling like you are ready to do something about your anxiety or take the next step, don’t just think about it, take massive action, right then. don’t just write something down, buy a book, start listening to a podcast, book yourself in for counselling, tell your friends about your plans. our brains convince us out of anything uncomfortable in a matter of seconds… we are programmed to avoid any discomfort… the best think you can do is cease the opportunity and start making change. 11. ask yourself what anxiety does for you that is helpful.... what do you get our of anxiety? you might get sympathy, attention, feel loved, get days off, feel special etc.. make sure that the things you get from anxiety are replaced. ideally, if you get attention when you feel anxious or depressed, convince the people you care about to reduce their attention during those times, but massively increase how much they praise you when you do something positive that is challenging your anxiety. 12. push yourself just a little bit every day. you don’t have to live in constant agony, you just have to make a little progress every day… tiny bits of progress add up to massive progress over weeks, months and years. don’t focus on how big the changes are, focus on what your next step is. everything above is easy to get started with. it doesn’t need to be perfect.",anxiety,1

88fbf538-0576-403e-84cc-7a5b89dcb9ca,"5 things i am proud of this semester; 1. my presentation instead of not trying, i got up, brushed my hair, did my makeup and chose an outfit that made me feel good every single day this semester. every time i was on campus i made sure i made an effort in my personal appearance and people noticed. 2. i worked hard. i didn't let my inner saboteur dictate what i couldn't do. my designs turned out beautiful and one project is now being used as an example for best practice in my unit. 3. i pushed on. when i slipped halfway i gathered the pieces and kept going. even though i couldn't get out of bed for two days i didn't give up due to the shame of it. when i started having panic attacks i prioritised and honed in on what needed to be done. 4. i socialised. instead of giving into my social anxieties i talked to people. i made sure to say thank you if they held a door for me instead of nodding, i told a dumb joke if there was an awkward ""i know you but don't know you"" elevator moment, i offered them stationary if they were looking for something, i focused on asking questions about them instead of worrying about what to say when they asked about me. i had someone to talk to every class and i learnt some really interesting things from the people i spoke to. i smiled so much this semester and people smiled back. 5. i used selective honesty. i was honest with my teachers, i didn't just slink away or brush myself off when i slipped but i didn't subject myself to oversharing either. it took me a long time to realise i don't have to volunteer information. my teachers don't need to know i failed a subject last semester or that i've struggled through my degree but they do need and want to know if i'm struggling now. it felt good to feel in control of how much i would share while not being dishonest and they helped me when i asked for it. i'm really proud of myself. even though my life's messy i'm learning to manage finally. it's definitely not perfect and my mental health definitely isn't 100% but my self management skills improved so much this last three months so i'm kind of thankful to have this anxiety because without it i wouldn't be sculpting out the person i'm becoming :)",anxiety,1
98c66004-a149-4816-b296-4b1274921fee,"i have always had stomachaches caused by how i felt emotionally, as far back as 1st grade, and i'm 23 now. largely they are caused by social anxiety and emetophobia (me/other people/seeing it on tv, etc) i have a few tips that i thought i could share from my experience. they still happen but here are a few ways how i cope: 1. remove yourself from a public place if possible - bathroom, bench, hallway. fake a phonecall or be honest that you need some air, you don't have to hide that you don't feel well. not having eyes on me reduces the feeling immensely. 2. lay down or sit. breathe. 3. drink water, sparkling water, sprite/ginger ale, ginger/peppermint tea. 4. chew mint gum, mints such as altoids or mentos, or ginger chews (such as chimes). 5. blast anything on youtube that comes up under ""anxiety relief music"" in some headphones. 6. turn on a video or show you can get engaged in. something instructional such as makeup or a furniture diy helps my mind forget. 7. massage your stomach, sometimes i feel like my intestines need help with the gas building up. 8. my favorite over-the-counter remedy is a liquid medicine such as maalox or mylanta, it seems to cool down my whole throat and stomach. but the issue is i can't carry it everywhere. tums and other tablets don't do it for me, but you can choose your own options. 9. press the acupressure point at the junction of your thumb and index finger. i've helped many people by suggesting this haha at this point, if these methods don't help me after 2 hours and only get worse, i can assume what's coming next and accept my fate. even if it is scary, i know that i've been through it before and lived. unpleasant but i know my body is only trying to help me. there are some preparations i take to prevent stomachaches before they even happen. i'm sorry if you also suffer from the same endless cycle as me: stomach hurts &gt; oh no my stomach hurts what if i...&gt; stomach hurts even more. 1. learn and take food safety precautions. label food in your fridge. store food at the correct temp. wash hands. 2. don't overeat. order food that you assume is ordered more frequently (order a burger at a burger place, not a dish that is out of place like oysters). don't get drunk! 3. locate a restroom or escape plan in your head when you enter a new place (consider sitting at an aisle seat!) carry some of the remedies above like gum. ball up a plastic bag and keep it in your pocket or bag. i hope this helps someone! i know it's a tough thing to control, but having options will give you power!!",anxiety,1

4cef77ec-4d4a-415c-96db-0ed0460de955,"about 9 years ago i hit my rock bottom. i was having multiple panic attacks a day. i couldn’t eat or sleep. i was isolated socially. my doctor almost sent me to inpatient. i had to take 6 months off work. i have come along way since then. i haven’t had a full blown panic attack in years. i work a full time job, attend part time grad school, and am engaged to be married, anxiety is still a daily part of my life, but i’ve learned how to function better and not let it control me. i wanted to share somethings i learned on my journey. these are things that took time to fully embrace and make habits. i still struggle with some. i don’t expect anyone to read this and it changes then right away. i guess that leads to the first lesson. 1) this is a process. there are no easy answers but putting in the time and effort can result in change. 2) my brain is trying to trick me. i had to learn when i can trust it and when it’s lying to me. and when i realize it’s lying i know i need to re-evaluate and use coping techniques 3) i can’t wait until i feel better or less anxious to change my behavior. changing my behavior is what changes how i feel. my therapist always said: the same behavior leads to the same feelings. 4) i had to let go of the mindset of fighting the anxiety or trying to make it go away. it feels awful and you want to “fix it” but that only makes it worse. i try to think of it as managing and accepting my anxiety. 5) avoidance is a drug and my anxiety makes me an addict. addicts take drugs to temporarily feel better but they aren’t addressing what they are trying to escape and only making the problem worse. that’s how avoidance works. i get temporary relief but then i feel worse and it doesn’t help me learn to manage my anxiety 6) i have the right to ask for help and for what i need. this isn’t a problem i have to face on my own. i have the right to ask for help and support from doctors, friends, family, coworkers. 7) i had to learn to do the opposite of what my anxiety tells me to do. if someone asks me go somewhere and my instinct is to avoid it, that means i should probably do it. that’s how i learned that my brain was lying to me. this doesn’t mean you have to do things you don’t want to do if you actually don’t want to do it for reasons besides anxiety 8) i can function even when anxious. the anxiety can’t hurt me. it can make me really uncomfortable but i’m not in danger and i can still do what i need to do. 9) just because i “feel” something is true doesn’t mean in reality it is actually true. i may feel i embarrassed myself at a social gathering, but in reality no one else thought i did anything embarrassing. i had to learn how to challenge the feeling with reality based evidence 10) most important. treat yourself with self compassion. we are the hardest on ourselves and say things to ourselves that we wouldn’t dare say to someone else. try to change that self talk. you are trying your best. you deserve happiness and love. you have right to make mistakes. you have the right to forgive yourself when you let your anxiety get the best of you, checkout this link for more info: if i think of more, i’ll add them. i’m open to questions too",anxiety,1

9b863258-296b-4437-a3b8-617015624fef,"so i've had really severe anxiety and panic attacks for about 6 years. sometimes it was manageable, sometimes not. during the last half of last year it was really escalating to a point where it was worse than before, peaking around christmas. i was having panic attack after panic attack which was very unusual, and taking a lot more xanax than i ever needed to before. so i looked around the area and found a local hospital that had an anxiety &amp; ocd program, supposedly one of the best in the country. most of what the program focused on was exposure therapy and cbt. i feel like exposure therapy is rarely discussed here, yet it seems to be one of the most common methods among the psych community for dealing with anxiety. so here's kind of a simple break down on what they teach. #exposure *** **create an exposure program**- this is the hardest part and something that was foreign to me when i began the program. the intent of this is to expose yourself to what gives you anxiety, so that after repeated exposures the anxiety will lessen over time. so the first thing you want to do is to make a ""hierarchy of anxiety triggers"". you want to make a list of your trigger, whether you avoid it, and how much anxiety it gives you on a scale of 1-10, as such: **hierarchy** (people, places, thoughts, things, sensations) trigger | avoided? (yes/no) | anxiety (0-10) :--|:--:|--: riding in an elevator | yes | 5 showering | no | 4 this will help in creating your exposure program, as you want to begin with exposures that are lower on your hierarchy. if you start at a 10 trigger, you may not be able to handle sitting with that anxiety. you want to start with a couple triggers that are lower, like 2 or 3, where you can handle that level of anxiety and learn to handle these exposures. so take an exposure, for example, maybe you have terrible anxiety about driving. break it down into steps, it's better to include more steps, and smaller ones than you may really beed. if you do a step and it produces little or no anxiety, then move on right away to the next step. maybe the first step you just sit in the car in your garage or driveway with the door open. then you move on to closing the door, then adding the key to the ignition, then run the engine, drive to the end of the driveway and back again. you would then move on to driving onto the street, then back to the driveway, and so on and so forth. the point is that with each step, if it produces a decent amount of anxiety then your goal is to sit with that anxiety, until it comes down to about half of its original intensity. it doesn't sound fun, but you want your anxiety to go up, that's the entire point of the exercise. you will feel uncomfortable, and that's fine, that's the point. after repeated exposures that level of discomfort and anxiety will lessen. here are some other examples- people with social anxiety would go up to people and make small talk, or talk in our group sessions for their exposure work. another exposure quite a few of us would do is write out 'worst case scenarios'. this could be writing out a detailed scenario where maybe you die from a heart attack, or where you write out an idea of making a fool of yourself in front of others, or someone you love dies. you want to be as detailed as possible, you write it, then read it and imagine it, see if it gives you anxiety and then sit with it. then you would do a worksheet about your worst case scenario(posted down a bit further) and reframe your thoughts about this possible scenario. **panic exposures (interoceptives)** *** if you suffer from panic attacks, the goal of this type of exposure is to try and recreate the physical sensations you may experience during an intense panic attack. again the intent is that repeated exposure to these sensations will make you more accustomed to them, and make you less anxious when you experience them. if you have had an intense panic attack you know a lot of the common physiological manifestations- dizziness, feeling out of breath, increased hr, palpitations, sweating, shaking, cold chills, hot flashes, nausea, etc. so here is a list of interoceptives you can do to try and recreate symptoms that are similar to what you personally experience during a panic attack: -shake head from side to side for 30 seconds -place head between legs for 30 seconds -run in place for 1 minute -hold breath for 30 seconds -breathe through a large straw for 1 minute -breathe through a small straw for 1 minute -spin for 1 minute -do push ups for 1 minute -hyperventilate for 1 minute -tense your muscles for 1 minute -put books on your chest for 1 minute so you could do all of these, and then rate the intensity of the sensations you felt and how much fear it creates, and whether or not it's similar to the feelings you get during a natural panic attack. for instance: exercise | sensations | intensity 1-10 | fear 1-10 | similar 1-10 :--|:--|:--|:--|:--| so you choose those which give you anxiety, and sit with it. give yourself some time in between, then repeat. you do these until these physical sensations give you less and less anxiety. **cbt** *** essentially what cbt boils down to is changing your thoughts and actions(or behaviors) in situations. how you interpret and perceive the situation or object of your anxiety determines your discomfort. you can't avoid all situations and anxieties, so your goal is to fix your perception and attitude. what you can do is work on cbt worksheets to evaluate your anxiety, and your thoughts about them. we want to examine these thoughts and behaviors, and then work to reframe these thoughts. this is the worksheet we used: . there are many other type of worksheets you can find online as well. you can do these worksheets with any type of trigger you have, examine the trigger with a critical eye, and work toward reframing your thoughts when you have a trigger. much of this we know won't work when you're in the grips of a full panic attack, but the point of this is to nip your anxiety in the bud before it gets to that point. identifying cognitive distortions and moving away from anxiety will become second nature when you do more and more cbt worksheets. **things to remember** *** **your goal is not to eliminate anxiety completely** - this is something you may not think about, or goes against what you think you want, but anxiety is a natural and integral part of life. without fear or anxiety, you would approach a grizzly bear in the wild and try to pet it. we need anxiety, and we need to learn to live with it. **anxiety won't kill you** - anxiety is a normal human response our ancestors needed for survival, it will not kill you. it will make you uncomfortable, but it will not kill you. you're not going to go crazy, you're not going to die. **relaxation** - a good way to help calm yourself is to practice relaxation techniques habitually. there are various methods to achieve a relaxed state- abdominal deep breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, visualizing a peaceful scene. like everything else, you must dedicate time to these behaviors to reap the positive results. physiological responses to relaxation include a decrease in hr, bp, muscle tension, oxygen consumption, analytical thinking, etc. relaxation works to prevent stress from becoming cumulative, boiling over into anxiety attacks or increasing your generalized anxiety. **what not to do** *** **seek reassurance** - i would often do this with my health anxiety or panic attacks. i would check my bp or hr, my wife would comfort me, i would go to the er. these are all ways to seek reassurance, and they are not good for you. i often see comments in this forum about a loved one giving comfort and telling the person suffering with anxiety that ""they will be ok"", they shouldn't. you should tell your loved ones not to reassure you. receiving reassurance doesn't work, and it doesn't help in the long term. another way of reassurance is having support objects. maybe you carry xanax with you wherever you go, i did for years. or i would always have my phone nearby in case i need to call 911 because i have a fear of suddenly dying or suffering a catastrophic medical emergency. or i would always wear shoes in the house in case something crazy happened and i needed to be ready to go right then and there. these are all examples of relying on support objects, you falsely believe they protect you and you start to depend on them. this is another step where you need to start gradually eliminating the need to carry your support objects, you can and will survive without them. this leads me into the next point... **try to eliminate all uncertainty** - nothing in life is certain, and we have to learn to accept that. it's funny what we have anxieties about, and what we don't. i am a young healthy person, but i have had unrelenting health anxiety where i think i'm going to die, yet perplexingly driving in my car doesn't give me anxiety. this makes no sense! driving is the most dangerous and possibly fatal activity i do on a daily basis, but i don't give it a second thought! you and i may not be here tomorrow, or in an hour, life is uncertain, it's something you need to learn to live with. a lot of anxiety is about things we can't control, what may or may not happen. what if, what if, what if. ground yourself to your present moment. identify objects in your room, take deep breaths, feel the fabric of the chair you're sitting in, smell the scent of the air. you're here, right now, in this moment, be there. what comes will come. **distractions** - sometimes when i used to get really anxious i would play a video game. this would take my mind off my anxiety and distract me, i thought this was a great method. this is not the case. if your attention is engaged elsewhere then you don't have to worry about your anxiety. except this leads to a point where all you think you have to do is think the ""wrong"" thing and panic or anxiety may set in. essentially distractions are just a form of avoidance... **avoidance** - avoidance is a huge one, and one we probably all have partaken in. the problem with avoidance, aside from that it doesn't work, is that your world becomes smaller and smaller and smaller. maybe you had anxiety at the grocery store, so you avoid that grocery store. then you had a bad attack at a family members house, so you start avoiding that house. you avoid people, places, things, activities, suddenly you're feeling isolated on an island, which of course makes your stress worse and you feel more anxious. if you avoid all you fear, you don't get to experience what would have happened if you had encountered it. by ""protecting"" yourself against these things, you make yourself more anxious because you never overcome your fear of them. any place or thing could soon become an avoidance, how many more will there be? you must expose yourself, you must sit with the anxiety, you can and will overcome it, or at least tolerate it. **fight your anxiety** - in the program, my case workers always hoped i would have a bad panic attack so that they could make me sit with it. i never had one in program, but they told me they would essentially tell me ""you're having a panic attack? ok."". the goal is to let the anxiety come, acknowledge it, let it pass. my go-to for panic attacks was almost always the er, that was my flight go-to response. i have had some minor ones, and now i have sat through them. i feel like i'm making progress. **summary** *** i know this isn't comprehensive and there's so much more i have, i have a folder full of printouts and info. i went for about 5 weeks. i had to take klonopin for a while because my anxiety was so bad. i'm also now on an anti-depressant. taking new medication would always give me awful anxiety, so even being able to do that was a big obstacle i overcame. medication isn't always needed if you have anxiety, but for some it may help you. if anyone has any questions, please ask, i'd be happy to share or elaborate if i can. i just wanted to write this because i so often see people talking positively about receiving reassurance, which is not good, and so little talk about exposure, which has been shown to help so much. i hope everyone's doing ok, have a good weekend! edit: duh, of course i have to add a healthy diet, sleep, and exercise are also so important to your physical, and mental health. this wasn't discussed as much, but just a reminder to stay active and treat your body well.",anxiety,1

(also a bonus, there is no need to buy anything with real money here.) another favorite is plague inc. it really makes you think. 3. play with your pet. grab a toy and play tug of war with your dog. shake a laser point across the room and watch your cat go wild. put your hamster in a ball and witness his joy as he runs amuck. don't have a pet? i would definitely recommend one. dogs know when you're upset and will try to comfort you. my dog actually has anxiety as well and starts shaking when i'm upset. so a lot of the time i have to tell myself ""deanna, you're stressing the dog out, get a grip!"". and cats? there purring is super calming. 4. go outside and put your bare feet in the sand. its called earthing, i believe and has its benefits. look it up. draw in the sand while doing so. dig a small hole. listen to the birds and all the nature around you. 5. put on a funny show or even a cartoon. my favorites are impractical jokers, the carbanaro effect, and spongebob. its hard to be upset when you see jokers running around making you laugh. 6. solve basic math problems. what's 9 x 14? what's 27 ÷ 3? etc. 7. talk to yourself. tell yourself you are fine and that you are acting ridiculous over nothing. sometimes you have to be a little harsh to get the point across. i have tons more and may post them another time. if you have tips feel free to suggest them. i just see so many people on several different reddits asking how to cope and how to help their bf/gfbget out of them. maybe we need a huge list compiled of our personal tips since not everything works for every person. unless we already have that? i'm pretty new here. hah.",anxiety,1

once someone would find out my history, it would be huge red flags. i have become so used to sitting alone by myself, that i have no clue what to do even if i want to do something. i have no interest in sitting in bars or going to clubs. all i want to do is sit around and practice guitar and piano. my idea of a good time is sitting with someone playing video games, or watching netflix/youtube and discussing what we are watching, etc. i always had an interest in producing music, but i feel like i can't focus on those things because they are isolated activities and i have this large looming cloud over me telling me i better get moving because i have no friends and girlfriend. i have been saving up for a downpayment on a house, and i'm pretty much there, but now i don't even know why i want that. a house is for a family, why the hell would i want a 3 bedroom house all to myself? maintenance costs would be through the roof. why would i want a house if i'm not with anyone. i honestly don't know what i want anymore. every single day is the exact same, go to the job i f'n despise, and then come home to an empty apartment and sit around. it's even worse in these months because it is so bitterly cold outside that there is no point in doing anything else. i honestly don't see a future for myself. i feel i am at the stage where i am beyond help. i don't see myself ever being with anyone, and i will just become someone who's office job is all they have. i already know my family is disappointed. my mom actually sat me down a couple months ago and told me she was extremely worried about me because of the no girlfriend/friends thing. my sister constantly yells at me that i am destroying my life, but her lectures just stress me out even more. my entire life my family has done what i call ""cheap shots"" at me. little mental abuse situations. example: i don't see the ketchup sitting on the table and go to the fridge, not seeing the ketchup i ask ""oh, we're out of ketchup?"" to which my mom will reply ""it's sitting here on the table, what the hell are you, fucking blind?"" little shit like that, adds up over the years. i honestly don't think i will make it to 40 years old. i have had multiple online dating profiles for the last 8 years. i have not once had any luck. i try to make my profile as interesting as possible, soliciting feedback from people. i have not once received a reply from anyone that i message. i have even paid for these services. it has been the biggest waste of time and money. another thing that causes me lots of anxiety is my teeth. cavity after cavity no matter how much i brush and floss. all the teeth in my mouth have fillings, some more than one. i even have 2 crowns. i am pretty certain i will lose all my teeth when i am older. i have been told that i might need braces. all that does is further drive me into deeper depression. i can't mentally handle possibly having braces at this age. would make me even worse than i am in terms of looks and dating. i have a ""friend"" whom i text with a lot and he told me that he doesn't ever see me with anyone unless 1. they were a gold digger, or 2. it was a single mom with kids. do you know how terrible that feels? i constantly overthink everything. thinking about my hopeless future gives me terrible anxiety. i have a feeling of dread every morning going to work, which i think are mini anxiety attacks. i posted in another subreddit about finally going to a therapist but i felt like he felt that my problems weren't real. saying things like ""it sounds like sitting on the computer has gotten you nowhere. have you thought about doing outside activities or joining groups?"" geee!!! such clarity now!!! the funny thing is, is that when i'm alone on the computer i actually feel comfortable. but deep inside i have this voice telling me that things aren't ok. don't become me. edit: thanks for the responses. a lot of people here say i have independence going for me but i forgot to mention that i pretty much don't. after work i go to my parents house for dinner every night because i can't cook and that would require me to eat out every night. on the weekends i sit at my parents all day because i have nothing else to do. so my apartment is pretty much just a shack for me to sleep in until i have to go to work the next day.",anxiety,1

9d81b7ed-64c9-4320-a15a-8f3512da05d7,"i’m 28 years old and i have 2 kids. in the past year i’ve been diagnosed with postpartum anxiety, postpartum ocd, gad, and health anxiety. i’m an empath and highly sensitive person - i’ve always had anxiety and depression (i mean since i was a teen), but that was nothing compared to now. the birth of my son brought on so much more anxiety and then with the birth of my daughter, it truly exploded. i started seeing my therapist in july 2018 after my gp recommended her. i started going every week, then every two weeks, then in february 2019 my therapist and i decided i can start going once a month! i wanted to share with everyone how i’ve been dealing with my anxiety. • **therapy.** find a great therapist, or a doctor who will listen and help you find a great therapist. please don’t be afraid to mention your struggles to someone, even if you’ve been previously let down by another health professional. trust me, i’ve had my fair share of doctors who blatantly ignored my symptoms. please keep trying. • **journaling.** if you’re like me and you suck at journaling, i suggest checking amazon for the five minute journal. my therapist just recommended it to me. it has daily affirmations written in, weekly challenges, and the journal entries are done in the morning and at night so just keep it by your bed and you’re good to go. • **watch something comforting.** for me, it’s gilmore girls and one day at a time. • **boundaries.** some of my anxiety stemmed from a lack of boundaries with my family and my therapist suggested that i read stop walking on eggshells by paul t mason. it’s on amazon and it has really helped. • **music. **make a playlist, blast the music, and sing! my favorite band is say anything. the frontman is extremely open about his anxiety (and about having bipolar disorder, too). this reflects in his music/song writing and i find it comforting. • **eating healthy.** i changed my diet to a whole food plant based diet to get my health under control since i have health anxiety. i feel so much better! • **a community.** i read a lot of posts on this and other subs. i don’t really post a lot but just reading other people’s posts, especially on here, makes me feel less alone in my anxiety. • **a weighted blanket**. i try to get enough sleep, but most nights i just can’t. i have two young kids, so i usually get like 7 hours (that may sound like enough but, to be honest, i need like 10 hours to feel like i’m functioning normally). but my weighted blanket helps a lot. it doesn’t weigh much, only like 8 lbs but i just keep it on my upper body/arms and it helps me sleep well. • **try to open up.** some of my anxiety was from my husband and i having a disconnect because i shut people out. my therapist suggested the 5 love languages by gary chapman (also on amazon). my husband and i both read it and highlighted what was important to us and realized we weren’t showing each other love in the ways we needed it. this probably saved our marriage. • **take space when you need it.** i’m a stay at home mom, so by the end of the day i need a little bit of space. when my husband gets home, i put in my headphones and start cooking dinner by myself and he plays with the kids. i love cooking so much and it’s relaxing to me, as is music, so this really helps me unwind a bit. • **other lifestyle changes.** i quit caffeine for a while and no longer drink wine (i really only drank socially, but now i’d rather not). alcohol and caffeine were not good for my anxiety. i was drinking a lot of coffee so i needed to cut it out for a few months. now i drink one cup a day. • **self-help books.** the worry trick (on amazon, surprise)! this book has been great for me and i even bought a copy and sent it to my sister. she’s gotten further into it than i have and she tells me it’s very helpful! • **the 90 second rule.** my therapist told me a while ago that our brains only feel emotions for 90 seconds at a time. if i feel bad for more than 90 seconds, it’s because i’m allowing myself to stay in that emotion. that has helped me so much. now when something makes me anxious or angry or upset, i acknowledge it (sometimes in my head, sometimes aloud) and try to move on. i’m sure a ton of people already do these things, but i just wanted to share what helps me. i hope this helps even 1 person feel a little bit better. i just want everyone to know that i still struggle. sometimes i forget about the 90 seconds or i don’t take space when i need it. i’m still learning to manage my anxiety, but i’m much better today than i was 9 months ago. i’m sorry for the long post!",anxiety,1

97e511ca-ae85-4393-99da-9eba9d95334c,"hi, first of all, let me introduce myself. i'm 28 years old male and working as a senior software engineer. i'm good looking, live in a 3 floor house (doublex). my family is middle class, all alive and healthy. i saved enough money to purchase a flat just in 2 years. i have passive income from the games/projects i developed in the past. i have no trouble finding jobs. i can speak english like my native language and i am overall pretty smart, as i taught myself everything alone. english before i was 10, software engineering before i was 20 and i am still learning new stuff every day. i don't smoke, i don't do drugs, i don't do anything that is bad for my body or my life. if i am driving, i always stay below the speed limit just incase a wild animal appears on road from nowhere so i could brake quicker to save his life. people act like ""come on... it will take ages for us to reach our destination. speed up a bit."" but i reject it. we can be late but we can save an animals life unknowingly and prevent outselves from compunction. i am very emotional but usually i follow my logic. when i bring my issues up, people act like i'm bleufing and tell me that i should be happy because they just don't believe me and always bring the ""there are people whom is in worse conditions than you, feel better."" card. i just can't be happy. every single day i feel closer and closer to a suicide and lately i'm thinking about what kind of suicide i should prefer. seriously, all i want to do is get on top of a mountain during midnight, lay down, watch the space for a hour in complete silence thinking i'll be the last man alive on my entire birth chain, close my eyes and let myself fall down... i'm not kidding the slighest. i've always been suicidal but recently it got to a point where a it all matters on one-second decision. i don't know what is wrong with me but i will write my symptoms so perhabs you can help me identify my issues and seek treatment. --- during my childhood i always ripped my eyebrows and hair. half of my head was bald and i had no eyebrows until highschool. my parents moved me from a physocologist to another because they didn't know why i did it. my parents are very protective. i'm getting close to 30 and they still call me every hour. where are you? whom are you with? what did you ate? how much you paid? it is sickening. as a result, i have no friends because nobody wants someone like this in their group. the only friend i have is a guy whom i know since birth. we were raised together, went to same school together and he is like a brother to me. you may think it is a good thing because true friends are hard to find. let me clarify. he is the only one i went out for a walk for the past 3 years, the one i talked on phone. i just don't have anyone except my family and this guy. no school friends, noone in neighbourhood, nothing. this brought me another issue: i can't stand being in group of people. i've never been to a walk or sit on a table where there are more than 2 people. in addition, i'm also having mini-heart attacks even if a leaf drops next to me because i am so used to silence. a small sound such as a leaf-drop makes me jump from my chair. this grew another level of weirdness: i hide under my bed when it is stormy outside and i plug my earphones with maximum volume so i don't hear thunder volume/see the light. those mini heart attacks/shocks started to hurt. i black out for like a second. my heart always aches. when i go outside and it is about to rain, i am literally closing my eyes and praying it doesn't start raining before i get to home. when i get to home i instantly plug my earphones and hide under my bed. the worst part is, i had to do this when there are people in my house. everyone was like ""wow... how disrespectful!"" but they just can't understand the fact that i'm not doing this intentionally. i lock my room's door so nobody can see me hiding under the bed. there is one more thing i fear so much: getting laughed. god knows how many times people laughed me and thought i was some kind of a loser in my entire lifetime. ""a guy whom hides under his bed, haha. what a loser."" people gave me all the weird nicknames on high school and made fun of me. dead, zombie, graveyard, funeral, corpse, coffin... anything. my teachers were always proud of me and told my family that i could learn things in the future but not grow a decent personality like this. i wasn't good at school because i went my way. people would study biology, physics, math as our school curriculum consisted it. i would escape school to play games and do programming. anyhow, after spending an entire life in front of my pc alone, in silence, i had alot of time to question everything. nowadays, i'm in a complete emptiness. i was religious but i stopped caring about religion. i loved humananity but seeing how i was always abused i stopped caring about humanity. i stopped caring about my nation. i don't care about traditions. there are always huge crashes in me. i want to break my chains, i want to do something; on the other hand, i can't make decisions because i love my family so much and i don't want to be without them. my mind is full of negative stuff. it started to be a problem in everything about my life. for example, my company (where i work remotely) planned a trip to another country in this december, all expenses paid. i bet everyone would be amazed to hear it. me? i keep dreaming about plane crashes, i keep dreaming about being put into prison for something i didn't do, i keep dreaming about how i will get scammed and physically hurt. worst part? my coworkers whom never saw me before but always appreciated my skills, may notice what kind of weird guy i am. a guy escaping to it's hotel and laying under bed just because there are some rain clouds on the sky. i won't be able to be with them and it will always put me behind everything. i will be a random stranger in the company while they all become friends. wait, there is alot more. i always feel worthless. my family tells me to find someone and marry as i'm almost 30 and have a job. are they kidding??? i can't even make eye contact with anyone. i never spoke to a woman (except my mother and few relatives) on my entire lifetime nor touched anyone's hand. whenever i tried to do it i laughed to me face. for the past 15 years i didn't even say ""hi"" to anyone. i'm still a virgin. i can't even do anything sexually. i will never do it with money either because i am sure i will question what made her do it for money. i will never abuse someone just because life was harsh to them. i will dream about her birth, her mother holding her and wishing a good future for her. you know what, people laugh when i say it but who the fuck cares. it is either full white or full black to me - there is no gray, and i will stand by what i believe to be true. people are greedy. (well, science also says so) they dream about marrying, buying a car, having a house, growing kids, earning more money etc. i will never marry, i'm not confident enough and i fear not being able to protect her. even if a miracle happens i happen to marry someone; thinking about dancing in front of people during my wedding increases my heartbeat and makes my hands shake. did i tell you how i stopped caring about tradition and it is all black or white to me? i'll simply tell her about not making a wedding and tell everyone that they should feed 4 animals/children instead of buying us presents. (i always do those weird stuff and annoy traditional people. their stupid beliefs make me laugh.) rejected? okay. white or black after all. bye. she will feel like she is going to die in the first week and forget it on the second. i don't care about money. you will laugh at me... but few days ago i almost burned all my savings (valued approx $300k in united states) because i was pissed off. decided to break my phone into pieces instead and told me mother to hide them somewhere i can't react so i don't do stupid things when i'm angry. a guy telling his mother to hide his own money, all my savings for years, so he doesn't burn them for fun. i sure sound normal, right? the negativity i have is unbelivable but people think i'm just bleufing. my company wanted to give me a salary raise this year but wanted me to sign few papers for legal purposes. i rejected. when i sign papers i feel like it will be used to scam me (as our family had troubles with this in the past) so i reject everything. currently, i work without a contract, which means i'm not working legally/i'm an illegal worker in terms of law. i always question everything. there are like hundreds of questions on my mind at any given time. what's the purpose of life? what is the purpose of gods? when will my family die? when will i kill myself? how should i kill myself? how can i tell people to fuck off during my funeral? how can i reject the ""funeral tradition""? should i write a death note and tell them to not make any funerals for me or my ghost will chase them eternally? should i be buried or be burned in a crematorium? where should i ask them to bury me in? believe me, even at the most normal days, i think those like hundreds of times in a single day. my parents were so strict about me and it could be ""one of the"" reasons why i became like this. i'm allowed to bicycle but only on the road next to our house so they can watch me. not when i was 6 or 7. when i was 19 years old grown adult. i went to a school trip in my early 20's and they wanted me to call them every hour and give reports. my friend sometimes makes jokes about this situation and asks me if i am going to call my mother when i lose my virginity. ""yeah mother, she has a hole. we're still at the oral part. she went to bedroom to take her clothes off."" like, what? he is joking but that is the truth, sadly. in addition, i was always compared to other people. the random girl in neighbourhood whom scored a on exam, my father's friend's son whom was a decent soccer player. i never had a compliment until i started making money from my hobby. (programming) nowadays they act like: ""come on, why are you so negative? you're making a decent amount of money and your job is a great skill in today's world."" fuck the money if my family questions every single purchase i make. i can't even go out and have a nice dinner alone because they would complain and tell me that i could eat x instead which costs less. (remember that i told you our family had some troubles legally. we had to pay loads of money for something we don't know) i'm sick of this but on the other hand... i understand why they are like this. they don't even turn the light on so we could lower our electricity bill a bit. i don't blame them, because the next day our phone may ring once again and all my savings could be gone the next day. so, the crashes in me... should i live freely or support my family till the end? should i move to another country and finally break my chains and start a new life, or should i keep staying with them till the end? should i be ignorant like everyone else, follow traditions, marry, breed, be happy, or continue doing whatever i believe to be correct and honorable? why should i care about people's validation if i decide to ignore all of them and live happily with loads of dogs in a completely isolated wooden house? humans in my eyes (except a minority) are virus. their genes are greedy. they are greedy. they will destroy the planet they live in. they will blame you if you tell them their beliefs and traditions are stupid. they will spit on roads, they will rage during traffic, they will tailgate you, they will laugh at your face when they get the chance, they will scam innocent people. my anxiety is so intense. i can't even go to a 1 week all-expenses-paid company trip. i just can't guys... i fear everything. i can only work in remote because i hate open-space environment. i hate asking for private room either because it makes me feel bad when there are others working in open space. i'm not special. i feel bad when i treated differently. i rejected many jobs because of this (not offers, but when they told me to stay tomorrow. i took my papers and left the building) although i was jobless and were treated like a shit for a very long time. collapse over collapse, crash over crash and i grew a severe anger problem. the guy in traffic did something wrong, opened his window and blamed you? my eyes turn red, my body starts shaking, every single hatred i grew for humanity instantly adds up to my anger. i want to crash his car intentionally. i want to hit his car over and over again. i want to pull him out and punch him until he learns basic traffic rules. i fear myself hurting someone because i hate people who abuse innocent living beings. you may say, ""we all feel the same, traffic makes the people angry."" if you ever chased a car just to intentionally hit from behind, let me know. no, i'm a calm guy, really. i just instantly explode with anger on certain circumstances, especially when people are wrong but they believe they are correct and want to take advantage of abusing the innocent one. i also don't forget anything negative. if someone tells me ""oh hey mate, we didn't see eachother for the last 25 years. how are you doing?"" i can simply tell them that to fuck off just because they told me stupid and laughed my face 25 years ago. people's instincs never change. if they abused someone whom was weaker than them once, they will continue doing in the future. so, here i am. perfectly normal looking guy with a good job, family and a bright future, yet there is a complete chaos and clashes inside me that nobody can see. why should i care about a car, or a house, or a wife, or fame, or compliments, or money, or life itself when an epic ending to million years old life chain sounds much more tempting? the only reason i don't do it right now is because i don't want to make my family feed bad after my death. it must be a terrible feeling for my parents to lose their son. lastly, i can't remember things anymore. half of my thoughts are real, half of them are just made up assumptions. i am leaving house, coming back to check the door. a minute later i forget if i checked it, coming back to check it again. a minute later, once again and this time for good. when i google my symptoms up i get alot of results. severe anxiety, socialphobia, paranoid anxiety, astraphobia, panic attack, borderline personality disorder, even early levels of schizophrenia. what do you think about my issues? should i write a small note (a summary of everything i wrote here) and bring it with me to my physotherapist? sorry for the long post. wanted to give details as much as i can. thank you.",anxiety,1

(hopefully there’s no way for the moderators to tell that i manually clicked the leave button...oh great, now i’m panicking about that.) i am so tired of this. i’m an intelligent person with things to say. i just have zero confidence when people are looking at me. i’m terrified of being judged or saying some dumb. i can’t be the person i want to be, in activism or in my profession, if this is always happening. i don’t know what to do anymore.",anxiety,1

e7cd451f-4731-434c-b87d-9130551adeba,"i got home from my therapist last night and wife told me she had taken 24- 200mg seroquels. i called the squad and she was taken to a local er where they intubated her and got her stable. she is now awaiting transport to a psych unit. i understand this is needed and also that while she is in their care she is being well taken care of. however as my therapist has told me she is my drug and i feel so alone and lost without her. i am trying hard to keep it together for my kids and i am aware of some coping mechanisms that i learned about earlier this year when her and i were both hospitalized. i'm not sure how i feel at the moment, i feel a little numb to be honest but also so conflicted in my emotions. i've worked out and my frustration helped me set a new personal best on the dead lift, but nothing is bringing me joy. i don't feel as if i will do anything silly but i am glad that we have no firearms in the house. edit: update: she is still awaiting transport at this time last i heard. thanks all for the support and the great ideas on how to help my wife, myself and my family during this time. u/kev753 i like the idea of a letter, i will definitely do that. it helped when her and i exchanged letters when we both in the hospital last time. different units obviously but the nurses and pca's were very cool and allowed us to pass notes. also her parents are not helpful at all during these times. they feel as if they have done their time trying to understand her illness (bipolar1.) so there is no longer a need for them to be bothered when she is in the hospital for a mental problem; because according to her mother it is all just in her head. u/snugglyaggron i will gladly take valuable insight wherever i get it; even if it's from random strangers on the internet. one other note for now; while i have had my moments this evening with crying and all that that jazz, i have also been trying to ""detach."" the book ""co-dependent no more,"" by melody beattie has been really helpful and insightful in that regards. i will update as i hear more. thanks again all it does mean a lot to me. edit: update ii; i jut got back from seeing her at the psych unit. it brought back a lot of memories; because i was there myself in january. she was really wanting to get a shower and get cleaned up; which i take as a good sign. she signed some paperwork that stated she agreed to stay 7-10 days. i am not sure how concrete those days are; especially since she is really wanting to do a group therapy step down program. her parents are being asshats about the matter still, and she was upset that they were acting that way, and i get that it's tough when you do have the support of those who seem closest to you. u/iliketosmellmypoop you are 100% correct that there is almost no talk about mental illness, and it is really pissing me off too. i am now at the point where if someone asks how thing sare going i am going to be up front and tell them how my wife is doing, and what is going on; because fuck the stigma! thanks all for the love and support; i will continue to update as i can. edit: update iii for those still following. she was in better spirits when i left her this evening. she feels as if this was a call for help and that she is glad she got a ""reboot;"" now she wants to focus on not only getting herself better but also the things our family needs to do move on. again i thank you all for the outpouring of love and support. we're not out of the woods yet, but i think we can see a break through the trees. edit: update iv she is still in the hospital and when she asked about being released all she was told was this week. i have had multiple breakdowns over this whole situation over the weekend, but i haven't checked out yet. i know that will only solve the problem for me. she has had a couple of her meds changed and she was finally started on an anti depressant today. i know i am blessed that she didn't succeed in her attempt; however my heart aches for my wife. edit v: if anyone is still interested in this thread or not. i'm editing because i'm happy. both of us spent the past few days guarded 'ly' optimistic. however she is coming home tomorrow morning. just have to wait until i get a call to go pick her up. i am aware we both have a lot of work to do on ourselves and also in our marriage. thanks everyone for the love and support during this time.",anxiety,1

91b347c9-bb1f-404a-b3e5-8de69c2fdf37,"for a bit of context, i am in my first year of university. the school that i go to is fantastic, the people in my department of study are like one big happy family, and my professors are all super supportive (it’s a relatively small school, so we can talk to and get to know the professors well). i am the kind of person who really likes to support people when they need it. since uni is full of stressful times for everyone i have been able to bond with a lot of people and we come to trust each other pretty quickly. i’ve been able to help a lot of people, and they help me too. i have a really good group of friends, but i am also a huge introvert, and have struggled with social anxiety for a large part of my life. most of my friends know this, and they respect that, which i am always grateful for. they know when i just need to stay in my room instead of going out with them, and they know that when i am going through a rough patch and just don’t want to be touched they do other things for me like message me and send me things. everyone at that school is so amazing, except my dorm mates. there are 16 girls in the hallway that i am in. with the exception of my roommate (who is really sweet and shy, and we get along really well), all the girls are very much the typical party-going, loud, preppy university girls. not to say they don’t have their positive attributes, but in my experiences with them, the close-mindedness they possess toward things like other people, different life-styles, and respect toward personalities other than those that match their own has become very irritating yet constant aspect of my day. i have often wished that i could have gotten to know them before high school or something because they might have been nicer, but because that is not case, i don’t know them and they don’t know me. now to the actual event that i am frustrated with. one day the apartment representatives decided to do a q and a with my dorm about life in uni. (it’s important to note that my roommate had gone home for the weekend and was not here at the time) the questions were all anonymous and we just wrote them on little cards and put them in a bowl. questions were asked like “how should i organize my room?” and “why are we not allowed alcohol in dorms?”. i thought it might be a good time to ask a question, so i wrote down something along the lines of “what are some good actions to respect people of different personalities (e.g. extrovert vs. introvert)?”, with the hope that it was specific enough to find some suggestions, but not draw attention to the fact that i wrote it. i waited for a while, and thankfully my card was chosen. the answer was not as i had hoped. the conversation that followed started with the dorm representative talking about the difference between being outgoing and being reserved, basically stating that outgoing people take more risks and tend to get better opportunities for success and have a larger group of friends, while reserved people are safer with their decisions but it makes them less appealing, less likely to find a fun career or get married, reclusive, and more negative. she said that when it comes to an extrovert being friends with an introvert, it tends to be the extrovert who carries the introvert through life because according to her, more reserved people don’t have the mental capacity to deal with social situations ‘that are vital to succeeding in life’, and often the introvert can pull the extrovert down, and it’s important not to let that happen. she said that as women, it’s our job to be the kind of girl that a man will find attractive, and if we don’t put ourselves out there then we will never be wanted. one of the girls asked out loud what they can do to interact with and better understand introverts (which i thought was nice of her to ask), the response was telling the dorm that if your friend is an introvert, the best way to help them is by trying to break them out of their shell by forcing them to go to parties, keeping them entertained in social settings, and introducing them to your friends because if the introvert knows more people, they will feel more comfortable. the question concluded with the representative saying that if the person does not wish to follow your attempts to make them more outgoing, they probably don’t have a positive influence on your life and you should surround yourself with people who will be more supportive of you. fml. after that question i told my ra that i had to go study for an exam, and left before my tears were too noticeable. i walked back to the empty dorm and just sat and cried for a while. i had no idea that what seemed like a simple and helpful question would turn into the head of authority in the building telling everyone i am living with that all the aspects of my personality that i cannot change is a negative influence on everyone’s life and it should be their mission to either mold me into what they are, or to block me out completely. before they came back, i thought it would be good to maybe talk to them about my point of view so maybe they can understand where i am coming from, but as i sat in my room and heard them come down the hall, the only topic i could hear through the door was about how good the advice was about how to ‘deal with all those shy people around campus’. i realized that i couldn’t talk to them, both because i felt ashamed of myself for apparently being something inferior in their eyes, and because i didn’t want to face them if all they would do is criticize who i am. well the semester is over and i just got an email from my roommate saying she isn’t coming back to the dorm because of the unhealthy environment the other girls had created in the dorm. i honestly don’t know what i am going to do if one of the other girls moves into my room. the dorm has already become a stressful place to be for me because of them, and i don’t know how i will make it if my room (which has previously been my sort of safe haven because i can lock the door and block out some of the sound when i just can’t deal with people) is no longer safe for me to be. i hate this feeling, and while everything else makes me excited to go back to school next semester, i am actually scared to go back to my dorm. edit: thanks guys, i didn't realize i would get much response so soon. thank you so much for the support, i did send an email a while ago about it on behalf of my roommate (who did confirm that she is not coming back). i also ended up talking to a friend on campus about it, and have gotten some help from them. although *some people* might not understand the importance behind this kind of thing, i appreciate all of you so much, even if my petty worries are the least of a lot of our problems. thanks again :)",anxiety,1

0c380cae-61ce-4c64-a808-823c8150cd9f,"this post is long, and the first time i've ever written something like this out. i'm at the end of my wits and i feel like i might actually go mad, i don't know if writing this will help me, i don't know if anything will help me. but right now i'm out of ideas, and i'm hoping that there's someone out there who has been through what i've been through and has dealt with it, but i don't think there is. i have to warn you, if you're afraid of death then reading this post may only make it worse. anyway, this is my story. it wasn't that long ago, perhaps only a few months that i was in the darkest place that a human can be. sitting on my kitchen floor with an empty bottle of wine and a knife on my wrist, ready to end it all. and for the first time in my 25 years of existence i though about life and i though about death, after all i was going to experience both within mere moments of each other. a multitude of thoughts raced through my mind. what will it be like? what will i see? what will i feel? but what i realized terrified me, nothing. that's what you'll see. that's what you'll feel. that's what you'll be. do you remember what it was like before you were born? when you sleep? no. and that is death, it is the end of existence and the end of you. everything that you are and everything that you could be will be done and you will cease to exist. these are hard thoughts to have and in reality i rejected them. i rejected them for a long time, even though i'm an atheist i've always kind of felt like there was an afterlife, or that i didn't care. i remember myself once saying ""i don't care what happens to my body when i'm dead, i'll be dead after all!"" saying it without thinking about it. but, i carried on with life, woke up the next morning and remembered that i was going to end it, but stopped, and i felt happy. i enjoyed myself for the first time in years and was positive about the future. then new years came, it was late 4am or so and i was having a chat with a friend, he was drunk but i wasn't, i was reformed, no more alcohol for me, i was so proud of myself. but my friend seemed sad about something and i pressed him for answers, he admitted that he wanted to make an impact on this world, because he believed that it was all that he had, that after this there is nothing, and only your name remains. i had been rejecting these thoughts for so long but suddenly to hear another person say them drove them home. made them real. one day i won't just die, **i will stop existing** there will be nothing of me. but what's even worse is that there will be nothing of everyone i know. all my friends and family will one day cease to exist and be no more. nothing but memories in the minds of others, minds that will one day fade. since then everything has felt... surreal. like i'm not really here, i'm constantly feeling faint, nauseous, and afraid. my heart-rate is accelerated and i can't stop shaking. these thoughts drive me and punish me and i can barely sleep. everything around me seems insignificant and i can't enjoy anything because all i can think about is the inevitability of my own demise. but what makes it worse is that i think about my family and friends, how one day they too will die and cease to exist. and i'll never see them again, i want to burst into tears every time i see my mom or sister. i can't live like this but at the same time i'm terrified of dying. for the first time in my life i tried praying, i begged god to send me a sign, to put my mind at ease, anything. but i got nothing. i don't know what to do. i don't know what to feel. i don't know anything anymore and i feel like i can't talk to others. everyone just goes about their daily lives, but why. why do you care. you didn't get that job? your room-mate is annoying you? **who cares** nothing matters, stop worrying about such trivial things. how do people live normally, how did i live normally. i want to erase my thoughts, restart, but i can't. existence is torture and my mind is a trap. edit: this got more attention than i thought it would get. thank you for all the replies, i'll likely be reading and rereading them many times. edit 2: this thread got so much more attention than i could have imagined, there's been so many people offering advice and sharing their life experiences. i don't think i've ever seen so much helpfulness and friendliness on the internet before and i just want to say thank you. i think i still have a long way to go, maybe these thought's will never disappear but today has been the best day since they began and it's in a large part due to the people who spoke on this thread. i've read every post here and will keep reading them. in short just thank you, everyone.",anxiety,1

'if you ever want to overcome this, you need to begin to change'. i envisioned the person i wanted to be; even if i wasn't unequipped to be so at the time. **it took me one year** of very gradual changes to get to where i am now. one week sober. i closed up the shed, changed from bongs to joints and sat outside my house on a chair. the joints got bigger and bigger but a least i was only drinking 2-3 beers a day. i implemented hobbies back into my life. didn't spend a lot of time on them, but just 5-10 mins was a start. i joined a gym, some weeks i went once or twice, sometime i didn't go for a month. i reached out to old friends, sometime we didn't catch up until a couple weeks, sometimes we were both busy at different times, but i saw peoples faces and her their voices - after too long of seeing the same-old and only connecting with people through weed or alcohol (or other). had to work so hard to **prepare myself** to change my ways. it didn't take weeks or months. it took a whole year - 52 weeks of ups and downs, but a commitment to improving myself. it was difficult. it didn't feel like anything was different mentally until toward the end. i saw psych's, drs, counselors and was so optimistic they would help me change myself until i realized i already knew what to do. i decided i can channel all my anxiety into self improvement. bought a huge whiteboard, and everyday woke up i had these chores to do. idea's, reminders, quotes. things just kept coming to mind. things to fix/buy/take for a walk/hobbies to look into. i was still a depressed, anxious, alcoholic-stoner - but instead of watching tv, playing games, watching life slip away - i felt like i was on to something. i never expected the benefits from cutting down and quitting. every department of my life is better. i had to force change. it took me a year because change made me more anxious. **i've been sober for a week and the change is awesome!** i laugh, i stay active, i speak clearly, i look people in the eye, i get things done as i want to get them done - immediately. living a different reality. if anyone here is being controlled by these substances i just want to remind you that they are holding you back. these coping mechanisms are making you doubt yourself and not allowing you to progress - not allowing you to know yourself without them. i've heard every excuse in the book against self-improvement. don't gratify your situation. don't gratify your anxiety. it's a little runt that wants you to believe you can't change and will never be happy enough anyway. lower your pride to allow for change. take control of your life. learn to love yourself again (you deserve to). life will welcome you back with open arms.",anxiety,1

ace4a8ba-44f1-493b-8276-349561ecc104,"hey people, #tldr had anxiety and panic attacks for a few years, greatly reduced by doing a number of positive and simple things. i believe i've probably had anxiety for the majority of my life only it's manifested in different ways where it probably didn't effect me mentally but in other ways such as nail biting, restless behavior, appetite and so on. about three years ago i made and accidentally consumed 100mg of thc oil (aka cannabis oil, shout out to r/tifu). i had a psychotic episode and a massive panic attack where i basically thought i'd never come down from the trip again and be rendered insane, i saw demons. i eventually came down but for some reason since that edible trip i started to have panic attacks and anxiety regularly and at that time i had no idea what a panic attack or anxiety even was, i mean i knew what the words were but had no concept of what it felt like. i think the cannabis probably created some sort of mental bridge or neurological effect. i struggled pretty bad for a while there thinking i had done permanent damage, i questioned my own sanity, i fell into a bit of a depression where i specifically remember coming home laying in bed with my daughter and reading to her but thinking to myself that i'm broken something is wrong with me, i feel no joy, i love my daughter but i feel empty and alone sitting here, it terrified the shit outta me. luckily for me the short bout of depression passed and i think a big part of it was to do with me not understanding what was happening to my body with the anxiety and panic attacks. when i started to understand what it was i came out of the depression. side note, to anyone that says weed doesn't cause harm, like fuck it doesn't. i went through a period of 3 years of anxiety, panic attacks and a short bout of depression in part due to cannabis and i was lucky, i have a family, friends, support network, a job, a house and general nice life stuff. i can only imagine what that would to someone in a situation where they dont have that...i just checked up on my kids and a picture my daughter drew and posted on the bathroom door made me giggle, that's lucky, that's different to someone who has nothing. i could go on and on about this topic, but nevertheless i still support marijuana legislation. but anyway, moving along. around this same time, we put my dog down, my grandma went into a home, i had massive amounts of stress from work and my wife was pregnant and not liking the whole experience and so i ended up having a type of health anxiety mostly. i saw a couple gp's about it but they didn't say or do much and eventually my health anxiety got worse. i thought i had throat cancer, constantly thought i was having a heart attack and i'm talking when you're flying on a long haul international flight this is no fun at all. all of this led to me drinking more, taking stuff like ibuprofen and aspirin regularly, not sleeping well, eating more and eventually i hopped on the scales and was my heaviest, looked and felt my worsed. i was basically scared to death that i'd have a heart attack and partly that was anxiety but partly true too. i began to slowly change my diet, eating habits and started to exercise again but with work being the way work was i had a massive panic attack leaving work one day where i honestly thought i was having a heart attack, i was hospitalized that night. that apart from the short bout of depression was probably my lowest point. after that i got serious about my health and mental health. i have explored and experimented, seen dr's, started going back to the gym, changed my diet, my sleep, my job and thankfully i can say my anxiety is on its way out. the most recent things i did which greatly reduced my anxiety was to stop drinking coffee and reduce my alcohol intake. i had no idea coffee could cause such a big problem. it was around christmas time when i had my last big panic attack. i was hungover and had drunk quite a number of coffees that morning which culminated in us having to leave the shopping center and me going to the dr to get medicated which was a first. it took me a while to realize the coffee and alcohol was having an effect but wasn't until i had a weekend of 24/7 anxiety. i realized i had drunk quite a bit of both coffee and alcohol that weekend so decided come monday morning to stop. i switched to green and black teas during the day and herbal tea at night. the effects happened pretty quickly but probably took a couple days to really kick in. the first thing i noticed was i slept much better. for someone that was needing alcohol to get to sleep and wasn't going to bed till like 1am some nights or waking up breathless and anxiety ridden at 3am and not being able to get back to sleep this was a big change. i then noticed a reduction in anxiety and panic episodes overall but even when i'd sense myself getting anxious or that i could potentially feel a panic episode coming on it was far easier to control with breathing techniques. i think this is in part because your now just fighting the anxiety and not the anxiety all hopped up caffeine. to date i think i have had maybe 2 or 3 coffees in over a month now, maybe two months. and when i did have a coffee at work last week, i felt like i was about to have a panic attack at any moment and it was like that the entire day. the alcohol has mostly stopped during the week and reduced on the weekends too. when i do drink i try to get to bed on time, drink plenty of water and eat and it helps. not drinking during the week has been remarkable for my anxiety, my sleep and it also means less reliance on coffee. the journal thing was great when i could keep it up but unfortunately with my new job it's been hard. i still highly recommend it, it has a way of decompressing thoughts and emotions kind of like you're, your own therapist. all in all my anxiety (without jinxing it) feels like its on its way out. the biggest things for me that helped was general stress reduction e.g. new job, giving myself less responsibilities and taking on a more care free attitude like i had in my teens, learning a breathing technique called the butyeko method (highly recommended), getting myself checked out and quelling any health fears, reducing alcohol, stopping coffee, back in the gym, supplements, eating better, getting more sleep. i still have not seen a mental health professional, although that's on the cards for the next couple of weeks. peace out.",anxiety,1

52ce9e98-205d-4e5c-af10-bdeed74cee99,"sharing medical advice is bad for a number of reasons. even if a doctor, pharmacist, etc told you something that information may be specific to your case and not applicable to the op. the op may have other factors that complicate the situation which you may not even know about. recently someone posted that her husband, a pharmacy tech, said that a certain dose of ativan is safe. she didn't realize (or care?) that 1) pharmacy techs are not prescribers 2) the person she was talking to had a serious substance abuse disorder. i'm sure that dose *is* safe for some people, i've personally taken higher doses of similar drugs. but i had withdrawal, and it was shitty, and my own risk benefit analysis was different. everyone's risk benefit analysis is different, which is why they should only alter their dosing with help from their own doctor. not an internet doctor who hasn't examined them. when you give your advice, including recommending a dose, you are making it less likely that someone will consult their doctor and you are actively doing harm. consulting your doctor by telephone takes minutes and should be done whenever you have an urgent medical question that can't wait until your next appointment.if it's too urgent to wait for the doctor to call you back, you should go to urgent care or call 911. there is never a situation where asking reddit for medical care is appropriate. i do not know how to stem the tide of medical ""advice"" that is coming through this forum, but it needs to stop. i am contemplating making it a ban-on-sight offense for particularly damaging incidences. the only thing it is okay to say to a poster asking for medical advice is ""please consult your doctor/pharmacist/poison control/urgent care/hospital"" that's it. that's all you are qualified to say. this ties into our rule against alternative treatment, which at this time includes cannabis. the rule has *always* allowed for discussion of personal history though, so it's okay to say ""i vape before bed and i think it helps me sleep,"" just not ""you should vape before bed if you have trouble sleeping."" similarly, ""i take 2mg ativan when i'm angry"" is perfectly fine, but ""it's safe for you to take up to 2mg of ativan when you are angry"" is medical advice and is prohibited. we treat otc and rx substances differently. if you have scientific evidence in the form of a peer reviewed published study indicating that a certain otc (for our purposes this includes cannabis and behavioral modifications) substance may help with bipolar disorder please post it along with a link to the study! these substances are ones that an individual can, according to the government, probably take or learn about without medical direction, that's why they are otc. of course you should always ask your doctor for advice about any otc substances you take that might interact with your medication. you can't do this with prescribed substances. we know they help, but they can't be taken safely without a doctor's dosage guidelines and supervision. even telling someone to decrease their dose or how to taper their meds is not permitted. taper information is all over the web, for those truly in need. you know who else can help? their doctor. who they need to call if they are running out of meds. this comes up a lot, but you cannot help. please use this space to discuss these rules and how you'd like to see them enforced.",bipolar,2

[latuda copay 3. check if you have a preauthorization requirement for this drug. unfortunately this might require you to call your insurance company directly. some pharmacies might be able to tell you if its required. for me if my pdoc didnt submit a preauthorization the cost for me was near retail which is about $1300/us. 4. check if you have a prescription deductible. i did and at the beginning of every year it renews. so i was surprised to find that my drug i was getting for $150 was now ringing up at $400. sadly the only way past this is to pay it. but once paid, my cost was back down. 5. mckesson the company that provides the discount card will also provide you with two 14day supplies of latuda at no cost. that is right, **free**. just today i got my second free 14day supply of latuda. call them up at 1-855-5-latuda and you can speak to a rep to get this. they will provide you with the info that is used the same as another discount card. 6. lastly i was told of another option they have available where they will supposedly try to negotiate a lower cost with the insurance company. i'm not sure what kind of success rate there is with this as i have not yet attempted to go this route. this will be my last ditch effort before telling doc its too much and have to find something else. in order to do this you would call the same number above 1-855-5-latuda and inquire talk to someone about what options are available and perhaps inquire specifically about negotiating how much the insurance cost/pay. i only found out about this one as my insurance is always rejected with the card so i called the card company to sort it out and was somehow transferred to a rep that informed me this is what her department did, before transferring me to another. anwyays, hope this helps some of you. the preauthorization and deductible points should apply to all medications and is something to consider. its possible that the other solutions might work with other medications as well if they are cost prohibitive. edit: looks like the patent does expire on july 2 2018. so perhaps there is hope for a generic sooner than later.",bipolar,2

""i don't want to underestimate how difficult the bad times can be that some people go through with bipolar but at the same time i feel very passionate about the positives. if we are going to move on as a society -- in academia, in business, in entertainment -- we need people who will push boundaries. people with bipolar can do that."" references; the guardian, psychology today, science daily",bipolar,2

ca9c1424-5454-4824-9120-ce7ebabc356f,"i often go around saying it to people, but i recently let it convince me of something that simply wasn't true. and because i believed it, i convinced myself someone who matters to me was really upset with me when they weren't. and because the anger i perceived seems like it was unjustified, i got bitter and acted like an ass. and that wasn't okay. for all the progress i've made, for all my insight, i still have a great deal of foolishness. and perhaps some toolishness to match =p. but i digress. some recent life events have left me feeling really insecure and lacking, and i let those feelings convince me of something that just wasn't true. i saw the slightest suggestion they might've been right, forgetting all the evidence that wasn't in the immediate past, and let my feelings go down a dark path that kind of convinced me i was worthless. and i want to say i'm better than that. i wish i'm better than that; i hope i am. but it can still happen. anyway, i heard back from that friend and realized i'd let it happen and felt like an ass. so i did some introspection after that; i asked myself how i let it happen and how to keep it from happening again. as you've probably noticed by now, i try to make my posts useful to more than just myself; i want other people to be able to benefit and make progress--the rare exceptions typically being when i feel absolutely horrible and need to vent/need support and to give brief updates after making that kind of post. #and i realized something: a few things actually... * the reality testing i use to address psychosis to counter beliefs that seem insane could've helped me prevent these runaway emotions. reality testing, for those of you who don't know, often focuses on taking things from the real world you know to be true (in this case, conversations i know were sincere) and seeing if they're compatible with beliefs that you want to question. sometimes, as the absurdity and disconnectedness of psychosis can require, it means making choices to find evidence. generally speaking, when you do that, it's best to opt for choices that can find you proof but don't result in painful consequences in either version of reality. so far, i've found that the evidence has always supported conventional reality in the long run, so i'd like to encourage you to favor less painful consequences in that reality option. if i'd realized reality testing can address more than just psychosis, but also hyperbolic thinking, i might've avoided engaging in hurtful behavior. * i indulged a couple cognitive distortions / logical fallacies in concluding my friend was upset with me, and by identifying them now maybe i can prevent them in the future. lists of cognitive distortions that you can use to identify your own flawed thinking can be found and i let the recency effect (you more strongly remember things that have happened in the recent past than the distant past) enable emotional reasoning (something that can be hard to remind ourselves (and my dad has a terribly hard time with this sometimes) is that what you're feeling doesn't necessarily reflect the way things actually are. last night i was talking to a friend i was surprised to learn is a trump supporter, and i realized the extent to which i'd let the media demonize my view of him went further than i'd recognized--i'm not saying he's a saint, but i'm thinking he's much less of a nazi than i've made him out to be). * in rebt we talked about ""crushing ants."" ant stands for automatic negative thoughts. in the past i'd been really good at monitoring my thoughts and identifying irrational thinking like this, but since i no longer believe the people around me or the people i think of can hear my thoughts, i've focused more on motivating myself to develop as an adult and working towards a healthier relationship with mind-altering substances. this can be pretty difficult actually, and since i wasn't letting myself see that ***depression was lying to me*** and recognizing my cognitive distortions, i wasn't practicing what i'd learned by dismissing them as dangerous and without merit. sometimes the best way to address these thought patterns has been to come at them head on and challenge them (sometimes with reality testing!), and sometimes it's best to dismiss them and focus on something else. when you let them run unchecked, bad shit can happen like convincing yourself you're worthless. #the takeaway? **depression lies. i encourage you to use the comments to identify an insecurity or a negative thought train you sometimes let win out and address it with some of the skills here. or to share something you've been letting your negative self thoughts convince you of that you don't know how to disprove, so we as a community can address it with you and help you fight it off for the future.** ps: sorry for the extra-long post, i feel like i kind of needed to make it long to get all my thoughts out and to work through what's been challenging lately. i'm planning on x-posting this to /r/bipolar, since i know that while there's a solid amount of users who frequent both subs, there are also a solid chunk of users who primarily or only frequent one of the two.",bipolar,2

6b6096b1-5a52-4718-872e-4a622a025c50,"from the wikipedia article: &gt;most people who meet criteria for bipolar disorder experience a number of episodes, on average 0.4 to 0.7 per year, lasting three to six months. even rapid cycling is defined as pretty sporadic mood episodes: &gt;rapid cycling is defined as having four or more mood disturbance episodes within a one-year span. i cycle about every 3 weeks, with a week or two in between, about 10-12 in a year. that's still 4x as often as anything mentioned in the official diagnostic handbook. but on reddit and other forms i see a lot of people saying they cycle every week or everyday or even several times a day. i know rapid cycling is known to cycle that quickly in some cases, but i'd think that'd be pretty rare based on the average. the only explanation i can think of is that maybe that statistic is partial to people with bipolar i. folks with bipolar i, to my understanding, have fewer mood episodes, but their manic phases are longer and more severe, the concrete differences being that bpi often requires hospitalization whereas bpii usually does not. this, i think, would lead to more bpis being diagnosed than bpiis as well as being in closer proximity to researchers network-wise. it's impossible to control for such a thing because there's no real way of knowing how many bpiis are out there. but, at the same time, i've gone full manic and required hospitalization twice, so i'm bpi and i'm still cycling far faster than the textbooks say i should. another possibility is that this is all anecdotal, unreliable info i'm leaning on. probably not everyone who posts on forums and the like are officially diagnosed, their mood instability caused by a personality disorder or some other condition. i don't know. what do you think? is it a stats error, an out-dated understanding of bp in the diagnostic manuals, or just people confused on their condition?",bipolar,2

1e049020-9cd1-49d1-9e17-2578252a41fc,"as i mentioned in a previous post, i'd taking the company from a former contract to an employment tribunal as my contract 'coincidentally' ended immediately after i had one day off, several months in, due to depression. my manager had commented that i should 'just resign as you'll probably need to take a lot more time off in future and that wouldn't suit the needs of the business.' he also contacted me repeatedly throughout the day, by call, whatsapp, text, email etc. which i consider unreasonable. i'm due in court in two weeks time where we'll set a date for the tribunal hearing. i made my current senior manager aware of the case this week and she was very supportive, advising that my current contract length will be doubled. due to severe understaffing i'm currently working a lot of overtime, though the upside is that i've been too busy to worry about the case. my former solicitor is still too ill to represent me, so i'm seeking an alternative representative. in the meantime i prepared all of the legal documents myself, which while time consuming at least allowed me to broaden my skillset. i can't go into detail though the respondents have argued that i don't count as a disabled person, despite having medical letters from my former psychiatrist. i'd been advised by two gps that this would be their tactic in order to drive up costs, since i'll now probably need to pay for an expert witness and it adds several more months delay to the case. overall i'm dealing much better than i expected with the stress. i think once i accepted it, i eventually became used to the feeling and learnt to put it out of my mind as much as possible. my current job definitely helps because i'm there sometimes from 7am - 7pm, then i go to the gym and just watch netflix until i sleep. i'm also taking propranolol when needed and the side effects have generally worn off. if you'd asked me last autumn or even this january, i would have advised against pursuing a claim since it was very difficult to deal with then, but you develop resilience and it's important to challenge discrimination legally since financial loss and reputational damage is the only thing some companies care about.",bipolar,2

(you didn't remember?!) apparently his doctor said, he looked her up on the database and went ""ouch, cirrhosis."" hold up. what?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? my dad apparently didn't even ask, the dude just looked it up because ""he didn't remember"". for three years, my dad has been going around telling people she died because she took an immunosuppressant that made her vulnerable to infection. i told him we should have them check her liver in the hospital. ""but she might hear us!"" (she's in a coma?) when her liver did fail, this was apparently because she developed a rare form of the infection that attack the liver instead of the kidneys, and it must have just happened because obviously the doctors would have noticed... he also told me not to tell my sisters? i don't get it. my mom knew she had cirrhosis, and didn't tell us. because she wanted to keep drinking. i really don't think he loved her. i think he loved the world she created for him. and three years later doesn't even really know how to live outside it. **** there was one more piece to the puzzle, and that's where the bipolar part comes in. a few weeks before she died, my mom stopped all her medication. i remember sitting at the kitchen table at my old house as she dumped them all out in front of me, claiming she was fed up with ""big pharma"" and that she was wrong for forcing me on meds as an 11 year old with no mental illness at the time. it was like a twilight zone moment. (looking back, as i type this now? she must have knew.) but that included the antidepressant that was the only reason she was able to get out of bed. at the time we thought it was a bedsore that got infected. i'm pretty sure she wouldn't have died if she hadn't stopped meds... though not in the way it usually happens for mentally ill people. and i find myself in a similar spot right now. my meds are minimal (most of you would probably go ""aw, cute"") but i'm about to run out. i need to contact my primary care doctor because he's all i have now. so much i need to do and i've just been afraid to do it because... i've been depressed. i've just convinced myself it's okay, given current events. and in the past 48 hours i've really allowed myself to feel it. thanks for reading. even though bipolar is genetic i don't expect most of you to have experience with this level of parental shit, but this is one of the few places where i feel comfortable on reddit. after going through that shit three years ago this was the place that got me through... i'll never forget that.",bipolar,2
8c34ab44-ab74-44af-906f-8d022e7f0e72,"after a year and a half on lithium my routine lab on tuesday showed me at 2.54. never higher than 0.85 before this. primary told me to go straight to the er where i was admitted. they are treating for lithium toxicity and acute renal failure. i feel fine but my labs are not. i will not be allowed to continue on lithium past today unless my kidneys heal and they feel they have no other option. just a reminder, routine testing is important. once i had established a series of good tests my providers would ask me to go get one but they did not necessarily follow up to make sure that i had. that's not their fault, they've got a lot of patients, and it was on me to make sure that i got the job done. we don't know if missing a test was a contributing factor to this or if this was a freak occurrence that came on suddenly but i would just like to throw out the reminder that if you are on this you should make sure you always get the test done on a regular basis to avoid incidents like this. /checkyoselfbeforeyouwreckyourself update: finally discharged saturday night after five days/four nights. thanks to the renal complications they are completely changing most of my meds. no more lithium, obvs, and carbamazepine takes its place. swapping out seroquel for the newly generic abilify. my co-morbid heart issue will loose access to lisinopril because the kidneys need a break. losing pills for diabetes and going purely insulin. it will be a huge headache. someone asked me what symtoms i had and i said none. the more i spoke with doctors the more i saw what i had missed. the tremors were violent and disruptive. i had to pee urgently and fairly frequently. my skin had odd red patches that came and went. although i have a mirena and subsequently never had a period i did have one lasting three weeks until i entered the hospital. i justplain plain felt run down. it was easy to miss though because of work stress and and work schedules and denial. when i went to the er i honestly thought they could flush me with saline solution and send me home. the moral of the story here is if you are on this drug please read through the list of interactions in side effects and if you experience any of them to any degree please tell your doctor and have them check your level. a lot of these things i thought were mild or did not think we're a big deal to bother my doctor with and it turned out that an unlucky series of events meant that these things were in fact a big deal and should have been noticed. almost all side effects have ended since the end of my hospitalization, i do still have some tremors but they are incredibly mild and i suspect they won't be here long. get tested and get tested often.",bipolar,2

ea053c2b-7ce0-48eb-b6c3-f83dc4b8e0da,"hello all. i came to this sub because i don't know who else to talk to. i have few friends who could understand me but i can't even start talking about this without crying and i know how hard it is to see a grown man cry so i don't want to put anybody in that awkward position. when i started dating my girlfriend, one year ago, it wasn't long before she confessed she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 2012. back then she had a manic episode and was hospitalised. she spent two months in the psychiatric hospital and she said that was the worst thing she's been through in her life. i was still on ssri's and fresh out of depression so i felt that connection with her. i can honestly say that this is the best relationship i've been in and i've never been this close with someone before. i've never met someone who is this kind, always helpful to everyone and has a genuinely good soul. we talked about moving in together, even getting married. she was there when i quit taking ssri's and she has always been there for me no matter what. irony of it all, she's a psychotherapist. she works at the local clinic, mainly with kids, and they all love her. about six months ago we had a conversation about her bp and she told me that she did ""all the tests"" and none of them proved beyond a doubt that she's bipolar, but psychiatrist diagnosed her as bipolar regardless. she's been taking lithium and said that she plans to eventually stop using it and she discussed with her therapist to lower the dosage. she convinced me that everything is actually very promising and optimistic. in the meantime we moved in together and we've been living together for the past 3-4 months... last week she went on a trip to germany with her brother to visit her best friend living there. when they came back, almost as soon as i met them at the airport, i sensed something was wrong. she continued to be moody in the next couple of days, which was very different from how she usually is (upbeat, active, always on the go, doing stuff). i was worried but prior to her departure to germany she went to the doctors because she was complaining about feeling dizzy and having neck pain and headaches so i figured that was what's on her mind. two nights ago she told me she can't sleep. she went to the living room to watch the tv until she falls asleep and i went to the bedroom. when i woke up in the middle of the night she was still in the living room, awake, but acting very weird. she sounded confused, repeating things, asking about where her brother is and other weird stuff. her heartrate was very high. hours passed and she eventually started crying for no apparent reason (to me, obviously). she's been like this for two days now. when shes up on her feet, she seems ok, but as soon as she lies down to get some sleep she starts crying. she told me that few days earlier she ran out of lithium and couldn't get ahold of it and her therapist prescribed lamictal instead. she went on to have a day off without lithium, before taking lamictal. i read up on lamictal side effects and it added up so i thought that was it. next day she texted her therapist and he told her to stop using lamictal and go back to lithium. we called her friend, who's a doctor, and she managed to somehow acquire lithium for her. however, there was another twist. she was supposed to take olanzapine (zalasta) with lithium, but zalasta made her a ""walking zombie"", depressed and even suicidal and she quit using it on her own. after that, she started feeling way better and always thought lithium was enough. she would only use zalasta periodically when she had trouble sleeping, but most of the time she was only using lithium. i didn't know this up until last night. she kept this a secret from me because she was affraid i wouldn't understand and think she was ""crazy"". she said that in the past year (since we have been together) she only took zalasta couple of times. her parents and her brother are unhappy because of this, especially her brother who was beside her when she experienced her first manic episode. she's convinced she shouldn't take zalasta and her family don't understand how bad it makes her feel, but even so she started using it on a regular basis for the past few days because she had enough of her family giving her shit for skipping meds. i'm sorry i went on for this long but i'm scared shitless and don't know what to do. i can't help her but at the same time i can't stand seeing her like this. i just want her to get some sleep and feel better. one week ago our biggest problem was her not washing the dishes or cleaning up regulary, and now i'm just thinking fuck the dishes i just want to see her on her feet and feeling ok again. i don't know if this is the result of medication fuck ups or another manic episode, i don't know how long this will last. her doctor friend who got her lithium said it should pass in a couple of days and it's probably caused by shifting between meds, and as soon as lamictal is out of her system and lithium takes effect, she should be feeling better. **tl;dr** girlfriend diagnosed with bipolar disorder is having a rough time. she was supposed to use lithium and olanzapine (zalasta), but quit zalasta on her own few years back because it made her feel like a zombie. only use it when she has trouble sleeping. pharmacy ran out of lithium and her therapist prescribed lamictal instead, but very soon upon taking it she started feeling down, couldn't sleep and generally is unwell. she immediately stopped taking lamictal after two pills and went back to lithium which we somehow acquired via her friend. i don't know what to do, can't help her and trying to keep it calm but i'm not very good at it. **update** so me and her brother and her friend took hor to the er yesterday. they gave her glucose, sedatives and pain killers for her back pain. last night she took zalasta and fell asleep shortly after. she had 6 hours of sleep. today we took hor to the doctors to check her lithium levels and still waiting on results. but to make everything worse, her psychiatrist went on a holiday. however i am constantly in touch with one of her friends who's a psychotherapist working near her psychiatry clinic and i somehow took a snapshot of my gf's previous tests and evaluations and sent them to her friend at the clinic. she is now calmer, crying less, still hyperactive at times and quite paranoid. her brother was with us most of the time and he recognizes this pattern and said this happened before when she decided to quit lithium on her own. we also found out that she stopped taking lithium for at least ten days. we will decide the next step once her latest lithium level test results are out. thank you all for your advices.",bipolar,2

5fbd5479-1213-4f89-86e9-1fe03f60376a,"i was diagnosed bipolar 2 about a year and a half ago, but i havn’t had the opportunity to go on meds yet because i’ve been moving around a lot, lost my insurance, bullshit like that. i started smoking weed for the first time during a manic episode about 6 months ago and smoked nightly no matter what my mood state was. if i was manic i would smoke all day everyday to feel less “up”, and if i was depressed or baseline i smoked to wind down at night or to distract myself from being depressed. i swore by weed and told all my friends it was actually making me more stable, but i see now that i was just numbing my symptoms. i was in a manic episode for the last month of these 6 months, this recent february. every night during this month the smoking started giving me 3 hour panic attacks. it started slowly, maybe the first week i would just get paranoid about stuff like cops, and then i started hearing voices ontop of the paranoia, and then i slowly became convinced that i secretly had some medical issues that could kill me every second, and then finally the last week or two i would smoke and just become completely convinced i would die in my sleep. this even happened at a party, i didn’t even smoke that much but began hearing voices and had to leave the party early. it was humiliating. and being convinced you’re going to die is very traumatizing, especially when it happens night after night. i would be laying in my bed shaking, too high to even cry, and praying to god to forgive me for my sins since i was going to die that night, all while listening to classical music to try and calm down and hearing voices speak over the music. finally i just said, why the fuck am i paying for weed, paying to have these panic attacks? so i threw it all away. this was about a week ago, and i’ve been a week sober for the first time in 6 months. i can already notice myself returning back to normal. i hadn’t realized how much weed was affecting my brain even when i wasn’t high. i have wayyy less anxiety, whereas when i was smoking i was wondering why i was suddenly developing anxiety. i wake up feeling refreshed and not still high from the night before. i don’t think every little ache and pain in my body is secretly cancer or something that’s going to make me magically drop dead. i’m not paranoid about cops busting in and arresting me for no reason. i was derealized for a long time and nothing felt real, and now everything feels real again. i hadn’t realized how fucked up weed was making me. i guess i wanted to post this because i’ve seen people on here say the same things i used to swear by, that weed is ok to self medicate with and that it actually reduces your symptoms. if you start getting paranoid when you smoke, you need to stop before it becomes psychotic panic attacks like i was having. i finally feel like i’m returning back to my normal self. i’m not even sad about having to quit like i imagine doing i’d be. i have literally no desire to smoke anymore, i’d do anything if it means i didn’t have to suffer another 3 hour panic attack of hearing voices and saying farewell to the world as i fall asleep and prepare to die. so yah, use weed if you want. but be aware that it gets bad very quickly, and likely is affecting you when you’re not high and you don’t even realize it. take a week off and see what happens.",bipolar,2

3c4007c1-f809-44f0-a6ef-edd719c760ba,"i'm new here (24, f). i've always crept on reddit for good reads about various things. it was this subreddit that got me to finally make an account. like many, i identified as an anxious person for as long as i can remember. i was in a four year relationship up until this past august in which i was depressed more often than not, or at least on the verge of depression. there were many days i couldn't leave my bed and had no motivation to do anything. my ex boyfriend struggled with alcoholism and the denial of it, he was an angry drinker and damaged my self-concept pretty profoundly. when i finally was strong enough to get out of the situation, i was sleeping in my car till i found a new place to live in september, then i had no money because i poured it all into the move, i couldn't buy food some days as all my dollars went into my gas tank to get to work and school. in september i also started a new job in addition to my other one, i started my clinical psychology doctoral program, and an internship. i was reunited with friends from middle/highschool after my breakup who many i hadn't seen since before my undergrad career and my crappy relationship. i found myself going out every single night but still maintaining everything else in my life because i seemed to not need sleep like my peers. i engaged in risky behavior much more than ever before (excessive drinking, though i handle my liquor well, as well as unsafe sex, reckless driving, impulsive spending (particularly on travel and basically anything i wanted), etc.) i have the hardest time going home alone and often don't. after only being with two people before this breakup, i've now been with 6 more, men and woman, and its only been almost 6 months. when i have sex it's usually multiple times at night and then in the morning with the person. i still meet with more than one of these people to do so. between sex and alcohol and no sleep, i was starting to surprise myself with who i was becoming. as a student in the field of psychology and with experience working with others, i naturally started looking at my new behaviors and the almost ""high"" or ""stimulated"" feelings i'd have for days at a time. i seemed to have a newfound confidence and could appear to some as downright arrogant i feel, which is strange because i normally feel insecure and pretty self loathing after my bad relationships. it was almost like i was overcompensating to the highest degree, and i felt like i could accomplish anything, and it seemed these episodes helped me do so. i began researching bipolar but realized it wasn't that severe, and then i was looking into cyclothymia. seeing as i do study at a school that is full of actual psychologists, i contacted my adviser about my thoughts and went to meet with him to get to the bottom of my behaviors and if it was something to be concerned about. he confirmed that i had hypomanic episodes followed by periods of, not depression, but low periods that seemed much more intense after coming down from them. this resonated with me, and he also identified my feelings of insecurity and emptiness that i'd get frequently after an episode. i did not get a diagnosis because it was apparent that instead of hindering my everyday functioning, it seems to benefit me to not need sleep and i won't deny it, i love the hypomanic episodes (not so much coming down from them though). i have missed days of work/class because of these times, but not enough to cause concern i'd think. i just needed to get my story off my chest because there's not many people i can open up to about it, one person i did already stopped talking to me because i used to seem so much more ""positive"" and ""driven"" and he doesn't approve of my impulsive behaviors. this was upsetting, but i feel like he was overreacting. what are your negative repercussions like in your relationships? do you care? do you think they interpret your behaviors inaccurately or is it us that does so? will this condition get worse as i continue to welcome the episodes (i.e. by not getting sleep, engaging in impulsive behavior willingly, enjoying it, even)? how did you come to realize your hypomania/mania? what would you consider to be the point at which it is effecting my life negatively enough to seek an actual diagnosis? are these dumb questions? if you actually made it to this point, you deserve a medal.",bipolar,2

e7121f8a-9c6f-4e99-88bd-2ffcce6fd9ab,"i wear this pendant every day because of this woman: senua, from ninja theory's video game hellblade: senua's sacrifice. how come? what is it about, and what does it have to do with bipolar? i've talked about hellblade before on this subreddit, but to summarize, senua is a celtic warrior ostracized from her tribe and on a quest to hel to reclaim the soul of her beloved, who was sacrificed. she is severely mentally ill and throughout the game combats visual, tactile, and audio hallucinations, which she has to overcome to save her lover's soul. throughout the game are lorestones, an optional objective, but one that you can scan to unlock a tidbit of norse mythology as you wend your way through the game. near the end of the game, senua reflects on all the runes she's found (literally), before facing the final foe. this game was incredibly impactful to me. like i wrote to the developers, it gave me the language i needed to describe my childhood psychosis to others--just how fucking black it got. i had to play the game in pieces, an hour at a time, lest it overwhelm me. the throwbacks to my own experience and the feelings it stirred was, frankly, nothing short of traumatic. a good hurt, though, one that let me examine my own experiences in a new light, years away from them. this necklace i wear, originally touted as a symbol of odin (""put this on and feel odin's power! rah rah rah"") means ""bipolar"" to me. it means ""mentally ill"" to me. it is my own private way of paying tribute to my old experiences, of recognizing what will and what could come next, and as a reminder to prepare for those things by doing the right thing today--taking my meds, getting to bed on time, communicating, day by day and minute by minute. i like to think that this necklace ties me to senua. i like to think that the experiences that we--her as character, me as player--underwent together were as real to me as they were to her...and that like her, i made it through my own crucible, and do again, day by day. each time i get out of bed, that's a battle won. each time i journal my moods, that's a step forward. each time i contact my psychiatrist and keep them appraised of how i'm doing, that's a prayer to the gods, if you will. being bipolar can be unpredictable and terrifying at times. but wearing this pendant is a private sign to me, a coded language, that i use to feel connection to the greater community. i know i'm not alone. i know that i can reach out to the friends i've made here on reddit, in the bipolar reddits, for support and help and insight. but most of all, it's a reminder that whatever battle i'm fighting i have the strength to win it--whether that's the anxiety i feel about going to a coworker with an issue i've let sit, or whether it's discussing an issue relevant to your work with the ceo of your company (yes, this happened earlier today). it's small. it's private. it's mine. and i want to share it with you guys, because this is part of my experience, and something i draw strength from day by day. i hope you find something useful from my experience. because at the end of the day, we're all warriors, like senua, fighting to survive and thrive. because we're fucking worth it.",bipolar,2

(i begged not to be let out but the hospital staff said no program would take me having just had a suicide attempt and they stuck me in an outpatient program i blew off.) in a moment of clarity i asked for help, spent another week in an inpatient, then a month in a live-in partial inpatient program and stabilized on new medication. it's been over a year now since i've left that program and i'm doing great. i take my medication every day. i see my psych regularly. i'm back in school at a local community college and got a great job as a vet assistant and today is my first day i'll be able to be in surgery! i've finally found something that leaves me feeling fulfilled. i am happy; i am at peace. i just felt like making this post because for the longest time i thought i blew it and that my life was over. treatment takes time, but it does work. and remember to stick with those meds, give them time to work, and if they're still not working talk to someone, don't just stop taking them on your own. i know the feeling, my original meds made me lose my hair. but there are tons of options out there and you really just need to find the ones that work best with you. the point is, you can do this. we can do this! bipolar minds are some of the most brilliant and creative people out there. we just need to be a little selfish and take care of ourselves. help each other. i'm rambling at this point, but i just want you guys to know there is hope. the cycle you're in will end. if i can do it, so can you. pm me if anyone feels like they need to talk or vent. i'm here for you guys. lots of love.",bipolar,2

(yes bad i know!!!) so this is kinda something good. i guess. plus, i've been having pretty bad health anxiety recently and i think it would ease up a bit if i just got a check up. i fucked up badly last time with this pdoc and kinda wasn't super honest with her because i didn't like her or trust her. i wanted my old psych dr back, but she had unexpectedly moved. :( i think i need to give her a chance, though. so, going back into my old history of diagnosis, i was bpii and then got re diagnosed to bp1. i've been on just about everything i feel like... i've been on so many but here are the ones i remember (sorry if the spelling is whack).: wellbutrin xl: nope. hi, mania! prozac:(before the bp diagnosis): the reason i was diagnosed. also, hi, mania! seroquel: can we say t i r e d &amp; groggy as absolute hell? i could not function. abilify: oh, god the nausea. i threw up for 2 days straight, thought i had the flu, turned out to be abilify. saphris: god i loved saphris...while it worked. :( lamictal: this gave me some weird ass symptoms, including a pretty bad rash. xanax: for anxiety, i realized i was showing signs of addiction, so i quit. ** my new pdoc (the one i'm going back to) tried experimenting with some ant-seizure meds for awhile, i can't remember what they were called, but one of them gave me ""cold like symptoms"". i thought i was sick, i read the label and it legit said that it causes similar symptoms, so i stopped taking that cause wtf? they also didn't do diddly-squat. oxcarbazepine: also an anti seizure med??? was this a new thing or..?? anyways, these were the ones i remember, it was like a 2-3 year journey, and i don't remember the rest of them very well :/ but those were the ones i think i tried the longest or had the weirdest symptoms idk. so here's the question that's probably been asked a million times; sorry if it has: basically, what are everyone's experiences on lithium? i've been reading a lot and people have talked a lot about lithium for bipolar. i've done some research, read lots of studies and what not, but i want to know some personal experiences. i've heard wonderful things &amp; terrifying things. i've kinda hit such a low point with this illness that i know my brain needs a little help &amp; my symptoms have only gotten worse like the paranoia, and psychosis, stuff like that. i'm kinda ready to do almost anything. but yeah, sorry this is so long. yikes. is it as terrible as i'm reading about? with the kidney problems and stuff or is it more or less a safe thing as long as you keep up with the blood tests, staying hydrated, etc? i mean, i already drink a crazy amount of water a day, so staying hydrated shouldn't be a problem for me, lol. anyways, this is full of rambling. i'm sorry. thank you in advance and hope every one has a great day! :)",bipolar,2

b47f551f-b75b-4463-b609-21bf453df174,"this is a long story but i'm going to be as honest as possible for the first time in my life. that's the advantage of using a throwaway account. the reason i'm using it is because i deleted my real account. in fact, i deleted every other account on every website i have here on the internet, except for skype, because so many of my friends are on there, and yet, i think i will delete that too. let's go back to the beginning. i have always suffered. from the beginning of my life i have suffered, all the way up until the present moment. i have always suffered and the suffering has never stopped. don't get wrong, there have been moments of joy as well, and there have been real connections that i have felt with people in my life that have made it worth it, but the suffering has always haunted me. it has always followed me. it's always there, even when it doesn't feel like it, even when i forget about it. it's always there waiting for the opportunity to consume me. i have always suffered and i will never stop suffering. i have tried to do good things. people always told me that i was a talented musician and a writer, and so i made a couple of short albums, and i tried to write a novel, but nobody cared. nobody was interested. maybe the people who told me i had talent were just flattering me. i don't know. i did believe that i had talent but i don't believe that anymore. i pursued these things because i believed that it was the one thing i could make a meaningful difference in the world, and that by affecting people with the work that i did i could really make a difference, but i truly don't have any talent, and my work is terrible, and it doesn't affect anybody, and nobody cares. there have been periods in my life when i have been a horrible person. i have been disgusting to the people around me and it haunts me all the time. there have been times where i have become so solipsistic and cynical that i have treated people like garbage because i didn't think that it matted. maybe i wanted them to feel as bad as i did or maybe i just genuinely did not care about how they felt at all. but it haunts me now. i think about it every day and i hate myself for it. i wish i had never done those things to those people but i can never take that back. it will always be a part of me. it will always be what people think of when they think of me. they will always think of the horrible things i did to them. i can never change that. it will follow me for the rest of my life. i have tried to be a good person. the times that i have been happiest in my life is when i have honestly believed that other people were good and deserving of help and empathy and i have acted on those beliefs, but it's hard to sustain that for any length of time, and in a weird way, it's so much easier to retreat into my protective shell of sarcasm and cynicism where i can't be hurt by others because i can never empathize and therefore i never feel other people's pain, especially in the dog-eat-dog world of adulthood, i have very consciously acted in a clinical, unemotional way, and i hate myself for it. i wish i could be real and emotionally honest but i am so sensitive to any kind of emotional stimuli and it destroys me to feel the pain and sadness that i see all around me. if i let people get under my skin, i become very distraught very quickly. i hate that i became that cold person that i was. i hate that in the past, i have thought in such calculating, cynical, logical terms, manipulating others for my own benefit instead of truly caring about them and giving them the compassion and help that they deserved for being just like me, suffering too just as everybody does. something amazing happened to me recently. it was the most amazing thing that had ever happened in my life. i met a girl on the internet who is truly the most beautiful person i have ever encountered in every single way, which sounds like hyperbole or infatuation, and in some respects it is, but it's also genuinely true. a part of me had always fantasized that somebody like that would be out there, but i never thought it would be possible in real life, considering how impossible the harsh realities of the world make it to be the kind of person that good people genuinely want to be. it's for that reason and many others that i just never thought it would be possible. somebody couldn't that good. people couldn't possibly be that kind. nobody could possibly try so hard. life just didn't allow for things like that. it didn't make sense. it didn't seem possible. the best i could hope for, i thought, was that maybe i would find someone like that in a film, book or television show, but sadly, despite looking very hard, i had no luck. some sick part of me still must have hoped, despite everything, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that such a person could exist, because why else would i have been writing these songs and these stories about all this time and trying to make myself in the person that this imaginary girl would like? what was it that kept me holding on aside from the fear that there was nothing on the other side? if they gave euthanasia to depressives, i would have already accepted it a million times over, and yet i have continued because i am afraid to jump or hang myself or take pills or whatever you're supposed to do, and i have continued to suffer, at least until very recently, until this month that has just gone by when i met this beautiful person and for the first time in my life, i felt genuinely normal and confident. after talking to her and experience what i called her ""glow,"" i could go out and socialize like normal people do, and i could make friends easily, and i could effortlessly sustain faith in my ability to sustain normal adult relationships, despite the lack of available proof from the past. i must say, i have made more friends in the past month and a half than i have in the entire rest of my life up until that point. this girl has inspired my art as well. i have written songs about her and some of the lines i have written have been so good that i have been genuinely tricked into thinking that maybe there is some modicum of talent in me after all, but of course, the real reason is her, herself a talented writer, and the moment she goes away, i won't have that any more. when i am around her i feel like an amazing, extraordinary person who is capable of anything, and the extraordinary thing is that when i put it to the test, it's actually true, i really can do just about anything. i have always wanted to be a performer for instance, and so i went and joined a local theater group, something my anxiety, depression, self-loathing and cynicism would have never allowed me to do before, and yet, thinking of this girl, as i do all the time, even when i sleep, even in my dreams, i was entirely confident i could do it, and it happened without effort. in fact, the people there seem to like me an extraordinary amount, perhaps because they appreciate the positive energy that i have gained from this amazing thing that has happened to me. similarly, i have depended heavily on drugs and alcohol in the past to help me manage my emotions, to keep those horrible feelings at bay, but when i have been with this girl, i have felt absolutely no inclination to use those chemicals, because i want to do nothing to alter the ""glow"" in any way, to change the quality of it. the way that i feel in the days after we spend talking on skype is better than any drug i've been on. it's better than anything i could name. it struck me from the very first time that it made me feel normal like nothing else ever has, and it does, but at the same time, it's really scaring me, because i start to think of what would happen if she left me, which i know is only a matter of time because it's always been clear that i like her far more than she likes me. the day has always been lurking around the corner when she becomes bored of me and decides that she wants to call it off. in fact, that wouldn't be so bad compared to what would happen if she simply drifted away, gradually but eventually entirely. how can i deal with that? how is that something i can be expected to live with? in a way, it wasn't so bad the way things used to be before she came along, because i wasn't even aware that things *could* be better, that it was possible for me to feel relatively normal, happy and confident, and to effortlessly achieve things that i have always dreamed of doing, to live a sober lifestyle, to make new friends, to go after my dreams and hobbies without embarrassment, to talk to other people without a sense of perpetual shame and fear, to genuinely want to be kind and helpful to others, etc. etc. i have been thinking about this a lot, the fact this day will inevitably come, and i cry and cry, something which i hadn't done for years, not even when my life has hit rock bottom, because, in the words of dylan, ""when you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose."" the first month of our relationship will likely always be the best period of my life, but then something happened which i dealt with incredibly poorly and it fucked everything up. i got a message from her saying that there had been an incident and she would kind of remote and unresponsive for a few days. if it had actually only been a few days, that would have been okay. she wouldn't tell me what it was at first, which upset me so much, because i cared very deeply about her and i wanted so much to help and to understand what was going on, but she wouldn't let me in. i would message her on twitter and the fact that i was constantly bugging her about it made me feel like a complete creep, like the person i used to be, like the person who never in a million years could have imagined being anywhere near a girl like her, instead relegated to the shadows, away from everybody so that i wouldn't inflict my suffering on others, so i wouldn't bring them down with the toxic and cynical personality i had developed from suffering so intensely for so many years. so i cried and cried and worried for days and sought help where i could. i called mental health helplines and i stayed at my parents place and tried to tell them what was going on (although they didn't really understand). i got in touch with a doctor whom i am still corresponding, and just generally pushed myself harder than i ever had in recent memory to fill the horrible hole that was rapidly growing inside of me. i was filling it with all kinds of things, from hours of intense exercise every day (swimming, weights, running), making several new friends every day on skype/4chan/etc, talking for hours and hours and having these incredibly deep and beautiful conversations where i connected with these strangers so deeply in way that i never would have thought possible by simply being open and unafraid to be myself, a quality i had actually picked up from this girl. but i was relapsing too. i was beginning to use stimulants again to help me focus on my studies at first, because i had been doing nothing but think of this girl, and though it doesn't help me quite as much as speed or ritalin, it made a difference. i began drinking again, half a box of wine a night, because it made the feeling go away, and helped me to think about other things, and to socialize with others more easily, and to laugh instead of cry. it's like that r.e.m. song, half a world away: ""i've had too much to drink, didn't think, didn't think of you, i guess that's all i needed."" it worked at first but, as is always the case with these things, it's taking more and more to fill the whole, and so i am adding pharmaceuticals like opiates and benzos to the mix to try to make the feeling go away, and it's the same thing: wonderful at first, but now i need more, i need to fill the hole and nothing is quite enough. it's been a long time since i had the glow that i get from this girl, the one that keeps me sober, and i am turning back into my old horrible self, the one who doesn't care about anybody but myself, the one who was such a solipsist that i would do horrible things to people purely to relieve my boredom. everybody know that nietzsche quote, ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger,"" and some people have noticed that it's not exactly true: the things that hurt you and that cause you to suffer actually make you weaker. when you are in a perpetual state of recovery and when something new always seems to happen just when you think you are starting to get better, you are constantly weakened by the suffering, the suffering that doesn't stop, and the strength you need to be a good person and to do the right thing is this world is so hard to find when you are exhausting so much energy just trying to keep yourself and your life from completely disintegrating. it was my fault that the girl made the mistake of deciding that she liked me and that she wanted to care about me, because, of course, i felt the same way about her and selfishly decided to go after it it, and now she has to put up with all the ugliness and insecurity that, deep down, beneath the facade that put up for the people i don't want to hurt, is really there. now she has to tolerate the paranoia and the rages and the narcissism when she deserves so much better, and i have tried to explain this to her, and i have tried to break things off with her a couple of times because it will only hurt her but she won't listen. i can't keep doing this to her, especially in the state that she puts me in, when she gives me the strength to have the empathy i need to really care about someone, which paradoxically makes me feel what she feels so strongly that i am utterly overwhelmed by emotions all the time (she herself suffers from mental health problems, so you can imagine why it would sometimes be hard). now, even since the thing about her former boyfriend deciding to cut her out of his life two weeks ago, she has since emotionally frozen me out, i am becoming worse and worse every day, and i want nothing more than for it to end, nothing more than to stop hurting her, to stop harassing her, and everybody else too, like family, who doesn't deserve to feel bad about my problems either. i understand that there are good qualities about me, things about my personality and the way i am that people like. but in the long term, when they see the real me, how broken i am, what i am truly capable of, it's so devastating, and when it's somebody i care about as much as this girl, i don't know how i could possibly handle it. i can't put her through that. furthermore, because she has so completely changed my life and has been there for me so completely and has made me into a normal person and has really cared in a way that nobody ever has before, i have been become so completely in love with her that i am terrifying myself with the intensity of my love, terrified of how it makes me act and the thoughts i have about her (not sexual necessarily, i should say, which is a completely different story in itself), and i don't want her to be around that either, the unattractive creepiness and profound obsessiveness. i need her to be there to feel normal but i can't possibly see how it's worth it for her, and because i feel such intense empathy for her, to the extent that i feel her emotions more profoundly than perhaps she even feels her own, the thought of her having to put up with that, me compounding her misery like that, puts me in this state of perpetual anxiety with all these horrible physiological symptoms like a feeling of suffocating, a quivering tightness in my stomach, constant crying, trembling hands, etc, etc. i walk around and i feel so incredibly blessed and lucky that this amazing this has happened to me and, yet, at the same time so scared for her because of the person i know that i am and just how bad i know myself to be. these past couple of weeks have not only reminded me of what i'm like when she is not around, but also the fact that nothing can ever come of this relationship and that things will inevitably go back to the way they were before, something we knew from the beginning, because it's only on the internet, and we could never meet up in real life because she doesn't like me nearly as much as i like her. she thinks i'm joking when i say this, but the idea of living with her and getting married and raising kids is perhaps the first actually pleasant future i have ever realistically imagined for myself. the fact that it will never happen, and the fact that such thoughts are insane, creepy and inappropriate just makes it worse. she wants to be a friend because i suppose she likes certain things about me i guess, and yet i am struggling so hard to repress these feelings that are more intense than i could have ever possibly imagined, feelings i didn't know could even be felt, an intensity of emotion i didn't think was possible in anyone. i had hope for a very short while early on in the relationship because i genuinely thought something might come of it, especially considering that she would entertain my silly asides about getting married and having kids, and the discussions we would have about what to name them. and how many boys and girls we would have, and it was wonderful, and for the first time in my life, it gave me hope. late at night, she would send me messages on twitter saying she wished she was there with me in bed with, cuddling and watching tv, something so sweet and kind and from which she expected nothing in return. such relationships are not completely off the table for me as long as it's not with her, and i could have these things if i wanted, considering that i know of at least four people who have crushes on me, but the simple fact is, they are not her, and when i think of my future with them and then compare that to my future with her, i would be going through the motions instead of committing to this completely extraordinary things that i would spend the rest of my life in utter disbelief over, this idea that somebody so special and magical would come along and actually want to be with me for no reason other than the fact that i am me (certainly wasn't going to do it for the money or anything, because i don't have much going for me aside from personality and maybe looks, to some extent). the fact is, there cannot possibly be another girl (or guy) like this anywhere in the world because she is completely, utterly unique, not just in the sense that people are all distinct from each other, but in the sense that everybody else i have ever met is only a fraction of what she is, only ticking a few boxes while she nails every one, acing the quiz with flying colors. the way i see it is, the girls i've been interested in before, the reason i've liked them is because they were ten percent of what this girl is, whereas the real thing is obviously one hundred percent. the problem is that there is no future there because, as i have mentioned, she doesn't feel the same way about me as i do about her, and there is no financially tenable way for us to actually meet even if she did, and finally, because i am such a completely broken, crazy, insecure person, having a relationship with somebody like me when there are so many guys who would be much more capable of being there for her would always haunt me. what has happened is that i had a brief window of hope and now that i'm realizing it was a fleeting thing, i'm not sure how i'm going to go back to how it was. i have given up on my dream of making music and writing, as perhaps i should have done a long time ago, and i have deleted my various profile pages and websites which featured my stories and songs. i can't even entertain the possibility of dating because i was always holding out for somebody like this girl and now that i know for certain that there is someone out there like that, the idea of settling is not only difficult to accept, but literally untenable. furthermore, now that i know how much it people can hurt you once you open up your heart to them, i think i would be too afraid to ever do it again. we used to speak all time on various social media sites and i have erased my profiles from there too, because it's like smoking, i would rather quit completely than try to cut down, or, to abandon the metaphor entirely, i would rather not be with her at all than care about her so fucking much and love her so fucking much when she only thinks of me as a friend. of course, i know this is selfish, because i believe that she does need someone to provide companionship to her, and to be there for her unconditionally, and to support her in the ways that needs to be supported, but i have really tried to do that without bringing all of my complicated, creepy emotional shit into it and i just can't do it. i am just not strong enough which, again, is something i told her from the beginning, but like the other stuff, she just didn't want to be believe it for some reason, though perhaps her recent coldness means she finally is. it was better before, because i didn't know what it was like to have someone that i could love and trust completely, and it's like they say, ignorance is bliss. the problem now, really, is the hopelessness. i didn't write this necessarily because i was looking for advice, though please feel free to provide it if you would like, it more just that i needed to get this out of my system so that i wouldn't have it spinning around in my head keeping me up night after night in the future, though that will likely still happen anyway. it's one thing to have the hopelessness that comes along with depression, something that i have carried with me my entire life and which has prevented me from pursuing any kind of career or committing to any kind of long term goals, basically totally fucking up my future and making it impossible for me to live anything resembling a conventional life, but to then have that moment of hope, to actually be excited to get a job for once and to sustain a career and raise a family and have a reason to try to be good -- i mean, to want to give everything you can to support people you love and make things as easy for them as possible, and to then have that snatched away, that is incredibly numbing, so different to the emotional intensity of what we had, the rollercoaster feeling of following her through the high highs and the low lows. this has been an extremely long post, but hopefully i've been able to explain everything and articulate exactly why this feeling of hopelessness has returned, the fact that there will be no future as such, that i will never be normal like i thought i was going to be, that i would never spend my life with the most beautiful, extraordinary woman in the world like she was really convincing me we would earlier on. don't worry about suicide or anything because i am far too afraid to go through with it, but yeah, from here on out, it's going to be incredibly hard, and as much as i was grateful for what it was while it lasted, in a way, i would have preferred to not have been teased like that, to not know what it's like to be normal, because it was so good, and i will miss it so much, and it will be a very long time until i open up my heart like this again and allow myself to have hope even though it will inevitably be crushed, if ever.",depression,3

679b9610-2ce1-46ee-bfff-74ff07f0d94e,"i’m a 32 year old. last june i shot myself in the head, pistol in my mouth, drank a lot of whiskey for liquid courage and pulled the trigger. i was positive of my choice but i needed that drunkenness to dull the fear of what i was about to do. the bullet entered the upper pallet of my mouth, tore through and exited the left side of my face near my temple. i failed. a shaky hand, a drunken twitch, some base survival instinct in my subconscious, i honestly don’t know. i won’t get into a lengthy list of “why” i chose to do what i did. a laundry list of reasons are easy to come up with. it all came down to being a burden. it’s strange, that i hated my life and so many people are responsible for that mindset. yet in what i was wanting to be my last moment, i couldn’t help but think how much better off everyone else would be. full disclosure, i streamed my suicide on fb. i don’t remember doing it or why but i learned later that i did. i think i just didn’t want to be alone in that last moment of mine. i wanted someone to witness me and acknowledge i ever existed. i don’t support or condone that, it was cruel to put those people through seeing such a thing. all this is just backstory though. this is my first post and i’m not sure how long these can be. so i’ll try to end this quicker. nearly a year later and i wish i could say things have gotten better. i suppose in some small ways they have but in the most important ways they haven’t. i make no excuses for where i am in life. i could blame others but at the end of the day my lifetime of poor choices has led to my circumstances now. but even still, i don’t know how to live anymore. i get no joy out of anything. sex, hobbies, limited friendships. nothing sparks that lust for life. i don’t believe in religion but i can’t help but wonder if some higher power somewhere is going to realize they’ve made a mistake. that i wasn’t meant to be here. one day i will die but my fear of failing again outweighs my desire to make that happen. i wish i had the tools to really live again. i just wish i knew how to do more than exist. i don’t expect any conversations or responses. this is just a way for me to vent openly and not further burden those few who’ve stuck around despite my bullshit. maybe, if nothing else, if someone else feels the same at least you can feel less alone.",depression,3

ea6def73-2885-49ee-9498-840846f03b7d,"i've been with her for almost 7 years. i loved her a lot. i gave her all i could, and i liked how she accepted me for how simple i was. i tried everything to make it work - every time we fought, i'd make sure we patch things up and learn from it. i never gave up on her. i adjusted as much as i could, i gave way as much as i could. i carried her through all the shitty things that happened in her life. when her mom kicked her out of the house, i helped her move out. every time she moved out to a new place, actually, of course i was there to help. i was her boyfriend. i paid half her rent every time she needed money, even though we never moved in together because i had to respect her dad's wish. i saved my money and bought her things she needed but couldn't afford. i did all i could to help her become better in almost 7 years. a few months ago, she started being very irritable. it wasn't like her. i tried to be a sponge at first, absorbing it all and just helping her calm down and move forward, but it just got worse over time. a week before my birthday, i couldn't think of any other solution but for us to break up. i loved her, i really did, but it was taking a toll on our relationship. it was getting toxic. i was getting hurt and i couldn't endure it anymore. i told her we just needed some time to be better individually, so we could get back together as a better couple. it was mutual. it was painful, we cried, but we tried to be on good terms. 2 weeks after our break-up, which was a week after my birthday, she confessed that she got drunk and made out with some guy in a bar. it was painful, imagining it in my head. she told me she didn't like it - that it was validation for what she felt for me. i had faith in her, so i believed her and tried to brush it off. we kissed and i felt a sharp sting in my chest, but we didn't get back together. we still needed time off each other. almost every week i still went to her place when she needed me. it was stupid, i know, but i couldn't resist her. all my friends told me to commit to the break-up and stop talking to her, but i couldn't. she was lonely and she lived alone. i had to be there for her, even just for company. i told my best friends everything. i wanted their opinions and advice. i wanted to know if i was wrong, and i wanted to know what i could do better. they told me i wasn't wrong, and i just need to take this time for myself. a month after our break-up, i found out she already had sex with someone. she confessed about it too, and said the same thing about validation. i accepted her again, but the pain and the image of her doing it with someone else haunts me. it was different. it wasn't what i expected. she wasn't like that, i thought to myself. but the story was true, and there wasn't anything i could do about it. she said it validated her feelings for me, and i believed her. i secretly held on, still. i still had faith that she wasn't going to do anything to hurt me again even though we were technically broken-up - she promised it herself, too. i told her it wasn't going to work though, that we needed to really stop talking. i was scared of everything afterwards - that the longer i was away, the more she'd do it with other guys. the image haunted me, but the worse part is that i was losing my trust in her. i know it wasn't my business anymore, but it wasn't like i wouldn't feel hurt when i imagine it, or even hear about it. last night, she asked if we could talk. i was at work, so i went out for a bit to have a smoke with her. she apologized for everything she did to hurt me, and all i could say was how angry i was and how hurt i was. we parted ways awkwardly - she was hurt, and i was angry. there was a storm that night. there was heavy rain and strong winds. i couldn't get home, and i thought i needed to apologize to her. unfortunately, she told me she was staying at her mom's place and she wouldn't be there. since i couldn't go anywhere else, i told her i was going to her place and stay there for the night and wait for the storm to pass. i walked from my office to her place - the strong winds destroyed my umbrella so i was soaking wet when i got there. i unlocked the door, and saw her sleeping there with my best friend. it broke me. i couldn't feel anything. my mind went blank and all i could think of was find my way out embarrassingly. i lost my trust in her, and i lost my trust in my best friend. i didn't understand what was going on. i didn't know how long it's been happening. i didn't know how many times she's lied to me by telling me she was staying at her mom's place when she actually was there in her place with some guy. i want to believe that nothing's happening but my mind's killing me. images of her touching others and letting others touch her. it's killing me. it's making me numb to everything. i want to hate her but i couldn't. i'm so fucking depressed that i'm losing my love for her. there's no point in getting mad at my best friend too. he's the nicest guy in our group, and no one would believe me if i say anything. it will only make others look at me like some paranoid lunatic. i'm stuck. i can't do anything. i can't talk to my friends anymore. i've lost trust in all of them and all i could think of is how they'll judge me for whatever i'll do. i can't talk to her anymore. i'm just filled with hatred and sadness and pain right now that i can't even look at her the same way. i'm hating myself for losing my love for her like this, and i hate myself for holding on so vividly that i was blind enough to accept things for what they were. her being able to fool around with guys just after a month after our break-up, and having to sleep with my best friend of all people. it hasn't even been 2 months. i'm afraid to say i think she played me. all those sweet words about holding on and waiting for that time when we'd be better, yet having the audacity to do all these things just because i wasn't there. just because she was ""tired"" and she wanted to ""let go"". maybe this whole time it wasn't really *me* that she wanted. maybe she just needed someone, anyone, to be there when she felt lonely. and when i wasn't there, it was that easy for her to find replacements. yet i couldn't. i held on and tried to stay as strong as i could because i wanted us to get back together soon. i looked forward to the time i'd have to court her again and we'd have our spark back. now i can't feel anything. i've lost my trust in my friends and my love for her and i couldn't do anything else. i don't know what to do anymore. i'm so fucking tired. i tried so fucking hard to be strong for us and this is what i get. maybe i deserve this. maybe i wasn't enough. my thoughts are consuming me and i'm at a fucking dead-end with nothing to look forward to. i wish i could just die. i wish everything just stopped hurting me so much.",depression,3

that didn't last too long. i could never get over her. when we broke up we didn't even talk hardly ever after a few months. i know that this story is all jumbled, and it will be. i don't think i could make any kind of comprehensible story right now. god i remember everything. every damn thing about her and that we ever did, over the past 8 years. every. single. thing. from when i first laid eyes on her when she was my best friend's girlfriend, to the first time i went over to her house, to when she gave me my first kiss, when she moved away, when i was her support system, we were each other's only friends, when i'd stay up 8 hours a night to talk to her to keep her from committing suicide, when i found out she was pregnant with another man's child, when she was abandoned by her fiancee, when i told her i still loved her... she was my first and only everything, and i treated her like my god. first kiss, girlfriend, first in bed, first time i felt loved, first time i could talk about my true feelings...my first time being a dad... i remember talking to her mom and dad about marrying her. they told me they were so happy that i asked, that they always hoped for a man like me to come along. her and i talked about how we wanted to get married all the time. it was going to be so perfect. until it wasn't. life got in the way. we had both grown up so lonely, so abused, so broken. we didn't know how to love, how to act with those we were close to, because we were never close to anyone. she had postpartum. i was on some fucked up meds from destroying my back in an accident. we were both in school. we were kids, parents, students, lovers, and crazy in love. but when you have so many things pulling you apart, a slight tug is all it takes. neither of us knew how to deal with emotions. i'd say it was like a fairy tail and things are all right, but after all those things, we ended up separating. we figured it would be best for the time. we told each other we were just going to finish school, and get steady jobs. we'd get back together, and would be a happy family once more. again, life isn't a fairytale. it didn't happen like that. it became a love-hate relationship. we got jealous and envious of each other, it drove us apart, and only made our love-hate relationship become more hate than love. i feel like she hated me, and i ended up loving her. she ended up in another relationship, she got pregnant yet again, which truly ended things between us. but i still loved her. i knew that the girl i once loved was no longer mine, and wouldn't be. it was too late. it was so hard to accept another man's child into my life, but he was without a dad and it reminded me of myself. after only a month or so, that kid meant more to me than anything in life. i hadn't heard from her in a while. probably a year, maybe even a little more. yesterday, april 22nd 2019, i found out that she had died april 20th 2019. i found out today, april 23rd 2019, she was killed in a hit-and-run. i never get to tell her how much i loved her and that i was sorry for how things went. she'll never tell her kids how much she loved them. i'll never see any of them again. i knew things were over but it feels like i've lost them all over again. her children are now orphans, and if i could i would absolutely adopt them both. i would have the kid i was there for the birth of, and raised as my own for years. and i would have i second son. i knew i couldn't though. can't. god i wish i could. i blame myself. i know people will say that i can blame if ands or buts all day, however i know for certain that she would still be alive and two beautiful children wouldn't be orphans right now if i had just done things differently. i'll never stop blaming myself. i never did stop blaming myself and i sure as hell won't now. i should have been the one to die out of both of us. i have nothing to live for. i work a shit job that is of no importance, i've been having trouble getting into school, i have no motivation, i've had one girlfriend besides her, i have two friends, one i don't even know in real life, the other i rarely see, and i don't have children. i don't know how i'm supposed to live with this. i think i'm going to be alone for the rest of my life however long it may be. i wish i could kill myself but i know i can't. the only things keeping me going are the hopes that i can have children one day, the fact that a small amount of people would be upset if i died, the feel that i need to live with this intense guilt and pain for the rest of my life, and the slight stupid childish glimmer of hope that i might be able to do something for that baby once more. even if he's not a baby anymore. i'm sorry for the rant, but it feels like it's physically destroying me holding it in. i just had to put it somewhere. i just can't hold it in. i never thought my pain could get worse but my god it got so much worse.",depression,3

am i obligated to stay now that i’ve communicated that i can’t stop thinking about giving up and dying?” i heard a knock at the door and i prepared for the worst. i assumed that it was an officer or someone that can facilitate the process of transferring to another facility or hospital. it was her supervisor. i thought i heard my therapist whisper to her that she needed help. i’m so sorry, my therapist. i’ve caused you much stress, surely. i’m sorry that despite being familiar with these concepts of challenging and reframing my thoughts, you just can’t reach me. “fuck.” her supervisor stepped in and introduced herself, clarifying that she was another therapist that was supervising our case and was concerned about me. she wanted to assess my state of mind and determine whether or not my therapist needed to contact my family and mental health services. i had an internal meltdown that was i trying to mitigate at this point, but i needed to reassure her that i wasn’t in imminent danger. i needed to subtly retract the concerning things i said, but i didn’t want to make my therapist look incompetent or somehow jeopardize her. her supervisor took a seat on the floor and promptly tried to assess my state of my mind by asking me about my suicidal thoughts and feelings. i reassured both of them that although i struggled with these thoughts, i didn’t intend on acting on them. that i quite literally couldn’t, even if i wanted to. i clarified that i suffered every day, but that i wouldn’t take my life because of the impact it would have on my family. i was adamant that i struggled through it, for them. i couldn’t bring myself to do it knowing the disaster i would leave behind. she consoled me further while my therapist sat beside her, nodding in a sincere and understanding way. my therapist commented to her that i mentioned that i feared that i was wasting her time (confidentiality?), to which they both reassured me that i wasn’t a waste and that they were here to help me in anyway that they can. the supervisor tried to persuade me communicate with my family just how depressed i was, but i wasn’t receptive to the idea. the anxiety i felt at the thought of them knowing was just too great. if they thought about me for a moment, it was too much in my mind. at this point the supervisor said that i needed to check in with my therapist, everyday. they wanted to make sure that i was well and reassured me that they wanted to respect my privacy but that they had reason to be concerned. throughout this session, i felt like i was trapped. i’m trapped in a life that i don’t want and now these daily check-ins have made my life more difficult and stressful. i feel like i’m under a microscope and stuck in this process. i thought about withdrawing myself from treatment, but that’s out of the question now. it would raise an immediate red flag with my therapist and my family would wonder what’s going on. i’m just...stuck now. an empty shell, floating through a full and gray life with no purpose and fulfillment. tldr; i was honest with my therapist about the frequency and intensity of my suicidal ideation and now i have to check in with her daily. i feel trapped and overwhelmed by the therapeutic process and life in general.",depression,3

""that's just the drugs talking"", ""she's just tired"", ""that didn't even hurt my feelings"". he'd defend her to the bitter fucking end and i would get so angry at him for standing up for her. he'd make her food when she was coming down, he'd run baths for her, he'd go to the store and get her favorite snacks. the kid was love incarnate. and he was so sincere. it really looked and felt like he just had it all together. probably because i was so raw and emotional and angry all the time. i wonder if he held himself together for my sake. i wonder if that's what destroyed him. he was also incredibly intelligent. his dream, since we were kids, was to become a science teacher. and if i'm being honest, that would have been a waste of his intellect. he was a sponge. i remember when i was still in high school and was apart of a head start program with a community college. he was in accelerated courses in high school but he could take one look at my work and immediately grasp it. not only did he understand it but he could explain it better than my professors could. he did so much for me and i never got to pay him back for all the sacrifices he made for me. i remember when i started my period and our mother was completely fucking catatonic in her bedroom. he went and got tampons and pads for me with his own money and when i had cramps he gave me warm water, a tylenol and got my mother's heating pad. what 13 yr old boy would do that? what 13 yr old boy would even know where to start with that? he was a natural caregiver that never was taken care of by anyone else. not even me. i believe my brother was raped and even then i couldn't be there for him. i just didn't know how or what to do. he was 15 at the time. i got home and my mother was high in her room. i asked her where he was and she said that he'd be home soon. knowing my mother and hearing the way she said that i assumed the worst and called everybody in her phone went to all her usual stops and i couldn't find anybody that knew where he was. late that night my brother came walking down the street while i was on the porch with a group of friends trying to figure out where he could have been and he looked like a ghost. he was on autopilot and everyone immediately knew what had happened to him. he just had this thousand yard gaze and when we stopped him he would only say he was tired and wanted to go to sleep. i remember being overwhelmed by the situation. i just didn't know how to comfort him or what to do so i did the only thing i could think to do and i wrote him a letter telling him i was there for him and saw him no differently. he never mentioned the letter but i think he read it. he was a shell of himself for days afterwards and when he did finally begin to talk to me again he was emphatic that nothing had happened to him and that he was fine. again, i was incapable of being there for him so i just nodded my head and said okay but i know something happened to him. i know he had been through something that rocked him. this is a kid that refers to the day he had to hold on to the car as mu mother drove it as, ""advanced cardio"". he was unshakable and whatever happened that day shook him to his core. he had been my rock for everything in our lives and when he needed me, i balled up onto a corner and pretended nothing happened to him. i can't even imagine what must have been going on in his head that night. he deserved a far better sister than i was. when i graduated from high school and with my associates degree i was offered an opportunity to go to nursing school a few states away and naturally i saw this as our escape route. i was done with my mother and that slum so i told him and he refused to leave her because, ""leaving our mama alone like that is cruel. regardless of what you think about how she raised us, she birthed us. and i won't just abandon her."" that's who he was. that's the caliber of person my brother was. loyal and loving to a fault. believe it or not, there were worse mother's in our neighborhood than ours. and when little kids didn't have access to food, he would take food our of our house and.make them sandwiches or hotdogs. he was a hero. he's the kind of person everyone should aspire to be. my guilt in this comes in many forms but chiefly among them is how poor a listener i am. over the past two years, whenever i spoke with him on the phone, (because of course i left the state anyway because i'm a shitty sister) he would bring up these stories he'd read or seen about someone either killing someone or killing themselves and he'd say things like, ""everyone has a breaking point"" and ""you can only push a person so far"". because this kind of talk made me uncomfortable i'd change the subject or tell him to stop looking at that dark subject matter. again, i was completely incapable of being there for him when he needed me. so about a month ago i get a call from my mother. as soon as i answer she starts screaming and crying, ""[his name] is dead!"" over and over and over and over and over again. it was the most soul crushing moment of my life. i didn't want to accept it was real. i couldn't bring myself to speak and so i just hung up on her. she called back and i ignored it and kept walking. i wouldn't know until that night when i forced myself to listen to the message but she left a voice mail of herself reading his suicide letter and i can't even describe the emotions of listening to the voice of the person you hate most read the words of the person you love most. i just started screaming in my apartment. it felt like my heart was being slowly ripped out of my chest. i've never been religious, my brother was the religious one, but i dropped to my knees and begged god to not let it be true. to let me go to sleep and wake up and have it all have been a dream. i begged and begged for it to b fake and whatever cruelty exists did allow me to fall asleep and dream of him only to wake up to a world where he no longer exists. i'll never be able to forget his letter. the way he wrote about hating the world around him and constantly being disappointed regardless of how low his expectations for everyone else were. he used the phrase ""human decency"" a lot. and he kept mentioning how he was tapped and just couldn't take being here anymore. i'll share one quote with you all: ""i've spent most of my life trying to find a single reason to stay here. an earnest effort to find one single beacon of light, one sign from god, that being here--that staying here--would be worth it. and i did. i found two staring my directly in the face. you two were my whole reason for staying here. my reason for continuing to get up every morning. and perhaps i'm selfish or greedy, and god forgive me if i am, but i just can't do it again. i'm so sorry. i just can't wake up to this place again. nothing scares me more than the idea of awaking to this ugly world again. and it is for that reason that i won't..."" i'm hurting so bad. i can't eat and i've lost 10 pounds since last month. he was so godamn beautiful and he's gone. he was so gentle and sweet and good. the world should mourn him with me because it is short an angel now. and even now i'm selfish because i can't stop thinking of how i'll never play chess with him again. i'll never hear him laugh again. i'll never hear him singing again. i'll never see the way his eyes went back and forth when he was trying to figure something out. i'll never see that grin of his when he actually figures it out. i'll never hug him again. when i went back home for the funeral i found out that he filled his car with gas, gave my mother the keys and walked out to the riverfront before shooting himself. he also emptied his bank account and gave her the money and left her favorite snacks in the kitchen. for me, he left framed pictures of us in my old bedroom and all of his old poetry (he was a great writer) even in his final hours, he was thinking of the people he loved. i'm exhausted and i just want him back. i wish i could redo those times when he needed me. i just want my brother back. i just want all of you to know to be better than me. listen better than i did and be there for the people you love. i regret so much but i regret most that i can never even apologize for being such a shitty sister. tl;dr: i was a horrible sister. my brother needed me and i was truly incapable of being there for him. life gave it's worst to my brother and after years of giving life his best, he decided to end it. how can i go

thought maybe it would be a good idea to write my feelings out and see if anyone has gone through something similar. i'm 24 years old and i'm currently living with my parents. i studied business in college and i was very unmotivated and undisciplined. there were some modules were i didnt go to a single class the entire semester, but by staying up late the night before and cramming a week or two before exams i managed to graduate with a mediocre gpa(3.06), not great but way more than i deserved. i spent most of my time in college alone in my room just playing videogames or browsing the web. i had a couple of friends, but we would only meet up once a week and i had them before i entered college, so i didnt make any friends during college. i am a virgin and didnt have a girlfriend at any point in my life. i went to a catholic all boys school so i never really interacted with girls before college, and since i had very little social life in college i didnt develop any flirting skills. after graduating college i lived with my parents. my parents own a small business which i worked at once a week while in college, and now that i'm out of college i work there about 4/5 days a week. it's a mindless dead end retail job, but it makes my parents feel like i'm doing something with my time. i've gone to only one job interview but that was just to appease my parents, i never wanted the job and though the interview went alright i never did the excel test that was emailed to me as a follow up. i've lied to my parents about going to a few other interviews, but i actually havent. because i live in the country i'll actually take a two hour bus ride into the city, wander around for an hour or two and then get the bus home, making up a story about how the interview went to my parents. this has been going on for the past year and a half. now i'm genuinely nervous about going to job interviews because i feel like i've forgotten a lot of what i learned in college, although i still have the textooks so i guess i could cram. i'm not overweight since i've always been skinny, but i am skinnyfat since i eat sweets for comfort and do very little exercise. my sleeping schedule is also horrendous. i stay up until about 2am in my room with my earphones plugged into my laptop, even on workdays so i either get only 6 hours sleep on workdays or i stay in bed until about 12 am on days off. this is going to sound incredibly pathetic but from about 11pm after my parents go to sleep to about 2am is the time i am closest to being happy. i put on music i like and fantasize that i am a successful rockstar, or i listen to kpop and imagine i am a kpop idol, or i listen to anime music and imagine i'm a character in an anime. basically i imagine i am someone else and fantasize about that life. i have no interest in actually being a music artist, the only appeal is that i can pretend to be someone successful in life instead of a loser. throughout the entire day when im not working im basically doing everything i can to distract myself from my own life, by playing videogames and browsing the web until 11pm and fantasizing until 2am. i feel like this is very negative behaviour, first of all because by fantasizing until the early morning i have terrible sleep habits and my mood is worse as a result, creating a vicious circle where i'm less motivated to do anything productive, and secondly because this kind of mental escapism is just causing me to stagnate while my problems go unsolved. i am also running away from any kind of challenge. aside from lying about the job interviews, i've yet to pass my full driving test. my parents think i'm taking lessons but i'm actually just taking the car and driving around for an hour or two. my old driving insructor is actually very good, but i ended up getting badly injured last year and so couldnt drive a car for about 9 months. once again this is going to sound pathetic but i am nervous about calling him up for lessons again in case he thinks i'm a loser for taking so long to pass the test, or in case my skills have degraded so badly that he gives out to me. constantly using escapism to distract myself has also wrecked my focus and ability to concentrate. even as i'm writing this out i'm resisting the urge to play dark souls 2. this has basically been going on for the past year and a half after college. my parents are fantastic but i can tell they are getting frustrated and want me to move out and get started with my adult life. my main issue is that i just feel so apathetic about everything, nothing excites or interests me and it's like i'm empty inside. i am not suicidal or incredibly sad, but i cant remember the last time i was genuinely excited or happy and i just feel constantly numb. logically i know exactly what i should be doing with my life, like applying to interviews and going over my college textbooks, socialising more, eating and sleeping better and working out. my problem is i just can't seem to make myself care enough about these things to motivate myself to do them. i don't really care about most of the graduate level business jobs i see advertised, but there's no other carreer or industry that appeals to me either so i have no idea what i want to do with my life. i tried creating a thirty day challenge of going to bed every day before midnight as a first step of sorts, but i only lasted a couple of days before i started fantasizing about another life until 2am again. it's just so pathetic that at 24 i can't even fucking go to sleep like a normal human being. i've read tons of self help books, tony robbins, eckhart tolle, stephen covey, but i cant seem to make any long term changes. i've been trying to start and reinforce positive habits and behaviour since i was 16 so thats 8 years of failure as my track record. after writing all this down and looking over it, it's clear i'm a pretty pathetic person, particularly for lying to my parents and abusing their trust. i would just like to know if there is anyone else who was in a similar place mentally and how things turned out.",depression,3

48b8cc68-21f2-40ba-af22-e0592c6083dc,"when you have depression it’s like it snows every day. some days it’s only a couple of inches. it’s a pain in the ass, but you still make it to work, the grocery store. sure, maybe you skip the gym or your friend’s birthday party, but it is still snowing and who knows how bad it might get tonight. probably better to just head home. your friend notices, but probably just thinks you are flaky now, or kind of an asshole. some days it snows a foot. you spend an hour shoveling out your driveway and are late to work. your back and hands hurt from shoveling. you leave early because it’s really coming down out there. your boss notices. some days it snows four feet. you shovel all morning but your street never gets plowed. you are not making it to work, or anywhere else for that matter. you are so sore and tired you just get back in the bed. by the time you wake up, all your shoveling has filled back in with snow. looks like your phone rang; people are wondering where you are. you don’t feel like calling them back, too tired from all the shoveling. plus they don’t get this much snow at their house so they don’t understand why you’re still stuck at home. they just think you’re lazy or weak, although they rarely come out and say it. some weeks it’s a full-blown blizzard. when you open your door, it’s to a wall of snow. the power flickers, then goes out. it’s too cold to sit in the living room anymore, so you get back into bed with all your clothes on. the stove and microwave won’t work so you eat a cold pop tart and call that dinner. you haven’t taken a shower in three days, but how could you at this point? you’re too cold to do anything except sleep. sometimes people get snowed in for the winter. the cold seeps in. no communication in or out. the food runs out. what can you even do, tunnel out of a forty foot snow bank with your hands? how far away is help? can you even get there in a blizzard? if you do, can they even help you at this point? maybe it’s death to stay here, but it’s death to go out there too. the thing is, when it snows all the time, you get worn all the way down. you get tired of being cold. you get tired of hurting all the time from shoveling, but if you don’t shovel on the light days, it builds up to something unmanageable on the heavy days. you resent the hell out of the snow, but it doesn’t care, it’s just a blind chemistry, an act of nature. it carries on regardless, unconcerned and unaware if it buries you or the whole world. also, the snow builds up in other areas, places you can’t shovel, sometimes places you can’t even see. maybe it’s on the roof. maybe it’s on the mountain behind the house. sometimes, there’s an avalanche that blows the house right off its foundation and takes you with it. i saw this on facebook, it’s not my own. the person who wrote it didn’t care about credit they just wanted the message out there and i’ve never felt like something explained the struggle so well and wanted to share here.",depression,3

""darling i love you to the bloody stars and back again :) mum xxx o o o"". how can you say you love me and then but leave me? how long did you wait before you jumped? if i had replied straight away would that have been enough? why did you not call me? i would have come. i would have been there for you. my mind still wonders. is there a chance this is just a dream? maybe there is a chance it is someone else? i remember that you loved to hum. when i was a child i would pick on you about it. you would always say ""would you prefer me crying?"". i just sit here now crying. all i want is to hear you hum. your loving son. if anyone reads this. call your mum. make sure you say ""i love you to the bloody stars and back again"".",depression,3

(yes... i left only for this reason). not my wisest choices... but hey, i was a young mistake 2: being overconfident.. i knew it would be a disaster if i got caught... but that didn't stop me from flaunting coz i was a proud murtaad....(xd). so in my stupidity i let my cousin know that i stopped believing (we were both stoned) mistake 3: trusting the wrong person..after knowing that i was exmoose, my (haafiz stoner) cousin along with my extended family lured me to a bar and caught me there...stupid i know!but i trusted the dude unfortunately... things got really ugly after that... family intervention, less talking, more beating... finally a bakra (sacrificial goat) to realise their violent fantasies... mom tried to stop em, they said it was all her fault... dad was just shocked...couldn't do much the beatings didn't break me... the words did... as i slowly crawled my way to get some water , my aunt spilled it and said ""don't touch the water, your unholy touch will taint it, and we won't be able to drink it"". still makes me sick to this day. i finally knew what it meant to be untouchable. my concussed head could only think of suicide at the time ... so when everyone else was praying grabbed some essentials, 30 bucks and a swiss knife (coz if anyone came after me i'd kill them and then i would've killed myself)... they stopped me before i could leave... then they locked me in the balcony (my home for the next week) consequently... i had to drop out of college, they'd decided i would be going away to a madrassa for 6 months... my life was over, i knew i was never going to recover from this... so the night before i was supposed to leave for the madrassa i decided to run away, to either kill myself in peace or try my luck on the streets.. but this would probably be my only good decision, the reason i'm posting this right now... i decided against running away or commiting suicide. i thought i was a coward for not finding the courage to commit suicide, but it would take only a moment of courage to kill myself... but i would need courage for a lifetime if i were to live... i realised that this was my only shot at life and even if ending it would mean peace, i wanted to see if i could weather the storm and eventually do what i want to do and live a happy life. if it got too dark,this is my redemption arc: so the next morning, they found my stuff at the door and realised i was gonna run away... used that to somehow get through to my parents and didn't have to go away, but instead attend madrassa near my place where i could come home everyday the next four months of madrassa were hell... but the teacher at the place was a great guy... he was willing to listen to my problems and even debate with me.. of course i didn't buy his justification but atleast it we had civilized conversation. got out early from madrassa for good behaviour,got myself a job, did well, got a promotion to another city but parents didn't let me (family pressure).parents agreed to send me back to college but it was late in the semester... so lost 2 years of college if your wondering what happened to my backstabbing hafiz stoner cousin, karma got him, they found out about his colourful behaviour and things got bad for him. things are quite good now... my relationship with my parents is better than before, i'm doing well professionally (until i get back to college). ghosted the extended family, convinced parents how toxic they actually were. this phase would be the middle of my progress montage... i've not exactly made it in life... but i'm getting there, so i'm hopeful these would be the lessons i learnt from my experiences: 1. don't be overconfident and think it's okay to come out of the closet unless you have a backup plan 2. be extra careful who you trust, even your brother (not all) can betray you if they've got something to gain 3. carefully plan all your moves 4. try to gain financial independence as soon as possible and don't try coming out otherwise 5. don't let bad things define who you are, hardship reveals character 6. never lose hope, it all works out itself if you want it 7. time heals, things do get better 8. forgive but never forget 9. patience is your best friend if you've come this far, thank you for reading. just wanted to get things off my chest, hopefully you get to learn something from this. and if you're struggling right now, hang on...things get better only if you believe in yourself. i cant claim that others haven't suffered worse than me... but if i can try coming out of it, so can you good luck if you'd like to read a more detailed version, the links are in the comment section : [part [part [part",none,5

1695928e-cf6f-45d6-a2de-f114a4b96094,"context – yesterday in a thread i happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a tl;dr of the book once i am finished. on the onset if you have the time and resources, i would highly recommend reading the book. it’s published by juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at rs. 80. i have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. this is one of few good biographies i have read, partly due to the caravan magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (baba ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. it took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. the author – priyanka pathak narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for mint and that is where she begins on this journey. as part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including balakrishna – ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of patanjali ayurveda ltd. so here we go * baba ramdev (ram kisan yadav) was born in said alipur in a poor farming family. a sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. * somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of arya samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. he joined khanpur gurukul where he learnt sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be acharya balakrishna * balakrishna is quite into ayurveda and is from haridwar where he befriends **acharya karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken arya samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in yoga, indian philosophy and vedas. karamveer soon takes balakrishna under his wing and soon ramdev joins them after a controversy. * ramdev learns yoga from karamveer. to propagate yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **shankar dev**, a patron of kripalu bagh ashram at haridwar. shankar dev wants and only trusts karamveer. but since he is arya samaj member he is not just ready to take sanyas. sensing an opportunity, ramdev steps in. taking sanyas means two things - 1) he can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) he cannot maintain any material wealth. i am bringing this up of course because this is very important * balakrishna meanwhile sets up divya pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, swami yogananda. balakrishna himself from **nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport. * in early 2000s, aastha and sanskar become household name. the tv guys select ramdev over karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **an interesting story here is that after aastha turned ramdev down, our diligent baba went to sanskar paying rs 1 lakh for a twenty minute slot.** this is also where i learnt that channels like sanskar and aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for tv slots to demonstrate their abilities * we all now know the story. ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship * soon ramdev has friends at high places. **mulayam singh, nd tiwari from congress, sudarshan agarwal – ex up governor.** so when they are charged with sales tax fraud, sudarshan agarwal mounts immense pressure on sales tax deputy commissioner to drop the case and retire. * ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. his younger brother ram bharat is soon in charge of the finances. this causes rift between karamveer and ramdev. afterall ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. so one day, karamveer just walks out. * swami yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of divya pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** the neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. * enter rajeev dixit. a swadeshi and founder of azadi bachao andolan. ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of balakrishna and ram bharat * meanwhile, his political favors with the congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of food processing plants. but soon, due to not paying workers at divya pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of citu. brinda karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the union health ministries’ ayurvedic unit – ayush confirmed traces of human and animal dna. karat apparently met n.d tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action * soon ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. patanjali ayurved ltd is born over the controversial divya pharmacy. and here we see the next mystery. the disappearance of 77 year old tb infested shankar mahadev (ramdev’s guru). mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of ramdev and his deputies. police find nothing but a note in his room saying “i have taken some loan from you for this trust but i cannot pay it. please forgive me. i am leaving”. ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. * ramdev and rajeev dixit set up a new party – **bharat swabhiman andolan.** * the takeover of aastha – when sebi freezes 93% of aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. the installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to ramdev. part of this was done in faith. once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, ramdev bullies the owner and md into resignation. meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy sanskar channel for him. which that follower did. * as mentioned earlier, keeping inline with ramdev’s political ambitions, rajeev dixit and ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of balakrishna and ram bharat. soon, rajeev dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. the hospital said it was cardiac arrest. ramdev said on television that he had told rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, bp and heart disease. but rajeev’s brother pradeep says that he had no such health problems. next, ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in haridwar as dixit was son of the soil instead of his native wardha. but as his body was laid for public demonstration, the bharat swabhiman andolan workers were stunned. dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. his skin was peeling strangely. there was black, blue blood coming from his nose. soon there was hue and cry. the andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **hindu dharma.** when they refused to budge, ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘some people have come from mumbai. they want me to do a post mortem. such cutting is against hindu dharma’. soon ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats. * ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the anna movement. he wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger lokpal bill, ramdev was more about bringing black money back. so he sat on a fast onto death protest. meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior congress members (pranab mukerjee, p.k bansal, kapil sibal and subodh kant sahay). he then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. this ired the congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez** * part of the credit towards the success of patanjali should go to their ex-ceo – **s.k patra**. he helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on ramdev’s business enterprises by the congress govt. but soon patra’s influence once again made balakrishna and ram bharat uneasy. patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with baba. * today patanjali is the second largest fmcg company with revenue of **rs 10561 crores**. its best selling products are ghee – **rs 1467 crore**, dant kanti toothpaste – rs 940 crore. but patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - * part of the reason for patanjali’s market share is its price. its below market as baba believes only in taking a marginal share. but this is also possible because working at patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. economic times has published a transcript from the book on this section – * there are a number of violations flagged by fssai (food safety and standards authority of india) including license number fraudulence on patanjali noodles. a lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units. ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. he has no doubt helped popularize yoga and ayurveda in india. the people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. his close association with bjp government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. his target is to get patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. and under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. finally, i realise that the tl;dr post itself needs a tl;dr. but its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. hence once again would recommend reading the book. edit 1: formatting edit 2: woah! thanks for the gold kind stranger. though i would rather have people reading the book. while indian non fiction writing and publishing are much to be desired, ventures like these must be encouraged. that will allow us to see similar good books that talk about interesting men, policies, events etc.",none,5

acda1592-acdd-4367-bd86-0d0c87dba5df,"we all love to travel, and we all love to travel *cheaply* even more. if you are willing to play spirit's ""games"" then you can come out way ahead. their business model is designed to chew up and spit out ignorant people, so as long as you educate yourself then you are mostly golden. spirit has launched a ton of new routes all across the country, and you can get great deals if you are a little flexible on your travel plans. [check out spirit's route map to get a feel of where you might want to fly. **how to get a good deal:** sign up for their specials email. [linkage at least twice a week they typically have a 48 hour sale. typically a monday-tuesday and a thursday-friday sale. you don't have to sign up for the email though, you can just visit [this on their website to see what deals are being offered. note: most of the cheapest fares are on tues/wed, but i've had good success getting flights on fri/sat/mon. **$36 off each roundtrip:** i was intrigued by spirit's website saying ""lower fares generally available at the airport"". i'm at my local airport quite a bit, so i started asking them to price out some tickets and compared the prices to their website. i found out that every flight you take is $17.99 cheaper per one way/$35.98 per roundtrip when purchased at the counter. you can book months in advance, but the specials are typically only in the next 21-60 days. you don't have to ask for any special discount, it just prices out this way. additional note: make sure you find out when your local spirit counter is open as you can't buy airfare at their kiosks. the desks are typically open between 120 minutes and 30 minutes before a flight. **getting around expensive baggage fees:** unfortunately, the real answer is that you can't really. but, you can take full advantage of their free personal item size of 16"" x 14"" x 12"". you can get a surprisingly large amount of stuff in a bag that size. a few companies have started making bags that size and you can search ebay for a 'personal item' sized airline bag. ciao makes a bag that sells at costco for as little as $30. lots of times the check-in agents don't monitor closely and you can get away with a bigger bag, but if they catch you it's $100. if you are looking at a weekend getaway, there is no reason to pay spirit for any baggage fees! an ""advanced"" tactic is getting a jacket with lots of pockets, which aren't subject to being sized. i have a scottevest jacket that has 26 pockets and while i haven't used it to bring extra clothing with me, i can definitely say it is worth the nearly $200. **travel thousands of miles for $15** if you took a look at the deals page you saw that even without the $9 fare club (which is really unnecessary), you can get tickets as little as $34 one way. $34, minus the $18 you can save by booking at the airport means that you pay under $16 for a flight. i have no idea if the $9 fare club airfare prices out cheaper at the airport. would love to hear if that is the case. denver to atlantic city is 1,597 miles each way and you can fly it for $30 round trip. **examples of flights available *right now* for $15 one-way (available in reverse as well):** * atlantic city to atlanta, boston, chicago, or detroit * baltimore to dallas or myrtle beach * charleston, wv to myrtle beach * chicago to dallas, kansas city, pittsburgh, minneapolis, myrtle beach, or new orleans * dallas to denver, kansas city, or new orleans * and so on, and so on. [check em all out even if it isn't $15, it could be $25 or $30 each way which is still a smoking bargain. **other spirit pro-tips:** 1) **if you can afford it, purchase the ""big front seat""**. spirit only charges about $30-$35 one way for the bigger seat. it's basically a real first class seat and it is worth every penny if you have a long flight. [found a pic online of some of the older seats. as you can see, much much 2) don't expect anything on the flight. drinks/food is expensive, but it is available. not even if you buy the big front seat. 3) the legroom sucks. it's really tight. if you are 6' or taller then you should consider purchasing extra leg room seating. **what can go wrong when flying spirit and how to protect yourself** spirit typically only flies once a day (or less, maybe 3 or 4 times/week) to each destination. if they have to cancel their flight for some reason, then you can get boned. in the event of a major problem, their customer service is basically worthless and will certainly be swamped. you can protect yourself by purchasing your ticket with a credit card that offers free travel insurance. lots of cards exists that provide help if you need to book a hotel and can even pay for it (one of my cards provides $500/year in coverage). spirit also can lose your bag. again, book with a credit card that offers lost baggage insurance and enjoy some new clothes/makeup. while i haven't experienced any yet, you could also run into some nasty delays. i wouldn't count on spirit (or any airline) to get me there if i had to be somewhere within a few hours of landing. **edit: forgot frequent flier miles!** spirit will give you 8,000 frequent flier miles for free and one-way flights start at only 10,000 miles if within 1,250 miles. [get all of the redemption options here (pdf **the miles expire in 3 months if you don't have any account activity** you can earn spirit miles without flying (by buying things on the internet via their shopping portal). there is way more flexibility using award miles versus trying to nab $15 flights, so if you love the miles game, then spirit can be rewarding. this could be it's own whole post though. happy to answer any questions below. **tldr:** spirit has big sales, so look at their deal page. buy your ticket at the airport to save $36 per roundtrip. you get a free 16""x14""x12"" personal item, so maximize your use of the free bag. buy your ticket with a credit card that offers free travel insurance.",none,5

3c98f09c-7bc2-47d3-b95c-3787c2076dfc,"i typically use unbiased or progressive sources for my news and politics, so for one week i decided to limit myself to conservative shows on fox and websites like the drudgereport. i had of course seen clips from fox shows and even caught an episode or two years ago but i hadn't sat down for multiple episodes in a row like a true fan. my thesis going into my little experiment was that i would find that the conservative sources were more accurate and less cartoonishly biased and ridiculous than how they were portrayed in my typical news sources. my experience surprised me: * **the facade of debate:** if i only watched shows like the five, the o'reilly factor and america live with megyn kelly i would think that progressives were all weak, dim, unable to argue even basic issues, and that they didn't believe in their overly convoluted (read: not common sense) rationalizations. [the is a show with five hosts, where 2 co-alpha males and 2 attractive females belittle an overweight, gray haired buffoon who throws out half arguments then defeatedly nods and exhales as the confident and dismissive conservatives set him straight. on one episode of the o'reilly factor, they had a segment on the health care birth control controversy and they brought on a small time radio radio host who would make half a point, get cut off and mocked in a dismissive manner (pattern!) by o'reilly then giggle and acquiesce. in o'reilly's other segments, geraldo rivera and bernard goldberg, the latter a conservative and the former a fox reporter and dullard, would again half-heartedly make one or two ""progressive"" arguments then be set straight by o'reilly. * **the online echo chamber, or how to self-censor the greatest tool for communication and information since the printing press:** so the cbo released a new budget projection for obama's health care plan over 9 years, the big (true) story was that the new projection was [billions less than a previous and if you searched for articles from non-partisan sources that's exactly what you learned. however when i did a search for ""cbo cost health care legislation"" over the first 24 hrs, [i got a very different for me, the very first result was a [washington examiner where the journalist proclaims that the cbo budget shows a 1.76 trillion dollar cost to obamacare, which he says is nearly double obama's original claim of around 900 billion. the problem here is that his cost is a **gross** cost- it doesn't take into account offsetting revenue and spending reductions which would bring the cost down to ~1 trillion which is what the non partisan sources are reporting. seems like a clearly, egregiously misleading statement on the reporter's part and surely one that would be quickly rebutted by other sources telling the truth. the problem is that if you went to any conservative site over the first 24 hrs, literally every single site referred to the washington examiner article alone and made the same claim, that obama lied about the costs by nearly 100%. if you remember the recent study that showed that [fox news viewers are actually less informed than people who don't watch news at you can now see exactly how this happens. finally- * **talking points as journalism:** prior to my week of conservative media i saw a [daily show about a conservative talking points memo that fox news's steve doocy erroneously read on the air. indeed, the most striking part of my experience was how consistently the same set of talking points were made across all conservative media. on every show and every website the same ""common sense"" conclusions were made by both ""opinion"" pundits like o'reilly and supposedly objective fox reporters: a) gas prices were not only controllable by the president but the current price was the result of his energy policy (not the shutting down of refineries on the east coast, not the massive consumption growth by the worlds two most populous countries china and india, and not iran's blockade of the strait of hormuz-&gt; a situation that is conveniently being exacerbated by us conservatives' saber rattling), b) obama lied about health care costs by 100% as i explained earlier, and c) bill maher's use of the word cunt in describing palin was equivalent to limbaugh calling sandra fluke a slut and obama was hypocritical to not return maher's donation. i heard these same points hammered into my head over and over again, without any sort of nuance or debate. even if your media consumption included non-partisan sources, it would be incredibly challenging to not buy into the only arguments being set forth by every conservative news source that you at least respected enough to consume. if you believe that fox's reportage is compartmentalized from its pundit echo chamber, as they claim, then you have no chance whatsoever. the day after the cbo budget was released, every supposedly unbiased fox reporter's focus was on the 900 billion to 1.76 trillion dollar gap or on gas prices and the president's early refusal of the keystone oil pipeline. in conclusion, if you're like me and you avoided conservative news sources like the plague not because they were conservative but because you suspected the reportage was terrible, you were right. and if you feel comfortable in obama's chances for reelection, mostly because of poor competition, don't underestimate just how misinformed conservatives and right leaning independents may be. **edit:** i avoided adding an edit for awhile because the ""thank you speech"" edits drive me fucking crazy, but i do want to give a few blanket answers to the literally hundreds of direct questions i've gotten: * yes i'm aware that there is no truly, purely, unbiased source but i thought that was so obvious i didn't need to say it- apparently not... i'm a naturally skeptical person so even though i consider npr, bbc, pbs, nyt, reuters and al jazeera to be as close to unbiased as there is, i'm always wary of being sold to, and i watch for the sin of omission in their reportage. * yes i watched the supposedly unbiased reporters on fox news, i even emphasized this point in my write-up, but i guess people didn't read the whole thing. it's important to reiterate because this is basically how fox tricks you, as [david frum they convince you that every non-conservative source is biased and that only they are telling the truth. but as i showed in my cbo budget example, this is demonstrably untrue. * i absolutely, honestly went into this experiment thinking that some of my preconceptions would be proven untrue, and it truly made me nervous- no one likes that initial feeling of having deeply held beliefs shaken, it's very unsettling. but the truth was worse than i expected, fox tv is almost a parody of a propaganda machine and if you don't believe it try the experiment yourself, it doesn't take much investment to change channels and unsubscribe from [/r/politics](/r/politics). * many have asked me to do a similar version with the liberal media, but i already consume liberal media along with my non-partisan sources and you do too if you come to [/r/politics](/r/politics). the fact is, from my experience, when i learn something from a liberal source such as [/r/politics](/r/politics), huffingtonpost, the daily show/colbert, politico (may be considered neutral) and then i read the unbiased and the occassional conservative source, that ""liberal"" information is rarely contradicted by reality. when i took in conservative rhetoric i would often a) immediately know something was incorrect because of for instance my education in business and economics, b) find out later it was factually incorrect such as in the cbo example, or c) recognize the logical fallacy in their arguments- if anything proved the lack of sophistication of their audience, it was that they would tolerate such terrible argumentation. if you looked at my link to the study about how[ informed particular viewers you can see that even comedic satire from the daily show gets you closer to the facts than so-called news from fox. * finally, i just wanted to say that i will now continue to consume conservative sources (i have drudge as a favorite) because i learned that it gives me direct access to republicans' game plan, and because it's always good to hear counter arguments even if they're not always intellectually honest.",none,5

&gt; conduit - metal pipe which is used to protect conductors. bent with either hand benders or mechanical benders depending on the size, also called pipe. the most common variety is emt (electric metallic tubing). i'll do my best not to go back and forth but i use them interchangeably so i might slip &gt; &gt; spring back - how far a conduit will spring back. if you're bending a 90 degree angle, you need to account for springback by over-bending the conduit by an amount equivalent to the springback &gt; &gt; travel - the length of conduit that feeds into the mechanical bender &gt; &gt; stub - on a 90 degree bend, this is the length of conduit that would transition from horizontal to vertical as the bender does its work &gt; &gt; leg - the length of conduit that remains horizontal following the bend &gt; &gt; gain - the distance gained back by executing a 90 degree bend over an arc instead of a hard angle. can be calculated as g= r(2-pi/2). i did this by subtracting the arc length of the 90 degree bend from twice the radius and simplifying &gt; &gt;deduct - the distance you need to subtract from your stub measurement to attain your desired stub length. for example, if you want to bend a 90 that has an 18 inch stub, and your deduct is 6 inches, you'd make your mark at 12 inches, place that mark on the designated spot on the shoe of the bender, and bend. manufacturers of benders will provide a deduct measurement for their benders (it's sometimes not accurate, but that's an easy thing to adjust for). &gt; &gt; shoe - the physical seat of the pipe. if you watch the video below it's the thing that actually spins, pulling the conduit with it. it maintains the form and radius so that the conduit doesn't kink or deform in some other way as its bent now, the specifics. when you bend large conduit, you use a mechanical bender, much like the one demonstrated in this video this is just one model by one manufacturer, giving rise to the first problem: each bender is different. even on the same model from the same manufacturer, different shoes can have slightly different results. i believe this is a result of them having different radii, but i'm uncertain. when you bend a 90 degree bend, you'll bend a piece, and then you pretty much have to eyeball how far you have to overbend it in order to account for springback. eventually, you get it tuned in, and most people will make a mark on the bender itself. what this results in is you usually have about 20 different lines, all for different sizes of pipe, made over the years. the bender on my current jobsite is very old, and thus only starts bending the conduit at its 5 degree mark (i assume it's just wear and tear and however many repairs have been made to it has just screwed up the alignment). because of this, it would be useless to add another mark, it'd just get lost in the mess. the math that i like to use is bending using travel. see, if you properly calibrate your measurements and calculate the travel for a 90 degree bend, you can completely ignore the degree markings. just measure off of a solid reference point (usually the bender itself) onto the leg of the conduit, make a mark at whatever your travel measurement is, and once that mark lines up with your reference point, congratulations you have a perfect 90 degree bend. this is also extremely useful for other bends. need to make a 45 degree bend? just halve you travel measurement. it accounts for springback on its own and eliminates a lot of guesswork. also, bending large conduit is difficult. if you underbend or overbend it can be incredibly difficult to get it reseated in the shoe of the bender (if you underbent) or to try and take some of the bend out (if you over bent). travel is an elegant solution to a problem that usually would require a lot of time and experience with a certain bender to correct. it has a downside though. you have to dial it in on a perfect bend. a perfect 90 degree bend where you didn't have to correct it a single bit. this is because those corrections change the actual bend that you're making, and can really throw off your travel measurement. so, it's a fiddly thing to get down, but once you have it it makes your life much easier. so what i'd like to do is try and find a way that i can take a measurement or two on the shoe of the bender, plug that measurement into an equation, and have a travel measurement that's accurate enough to use. if it's even within an eighth of an inch, accuracy wise, that would still dramatically reduce the amount of trial and error necessary to get a usable measurement. in my attempts to do this myself these are the problems i've run into: 1) it seems to me that this would have to be a measurement based off of the radius of the bend, but what do i measure to? the side of the conduit closest to the center of the circle? the center of the conduit? the center edge of the shoe? 2) a purely mathematical calculation of a 90 degree bend would not account for the springback in the conduit, and thus not be accurate. how do i account for springback in this equation? only thing i can think of is to spend my coming years in the trade finding the average amount of overbending that is required to account for springback and filter that back into whatever equation i develop 3) i don't think this is likely, as the conduit we use has to meet certain standards, but it's certainly possible: does springback change dramatically between manufacturers of conduit? or even between different batches? 4) could this be determined off of the deduct value? the deduct value can vary as it will usually be based off of the front of the shoe, and there is a certain amount of conduit between the front of the shoe and wherever the bend starts, so that could add in an extra variable thank you all so much for any help you provide. hopefully i broke it down well enough. if anyone ends up going down a rabbit hole and finding any interesting sources about this sort of thing please share, i'm always up for tangentially related info.",none,5

573cc9ca-1f5c-4e70-9338-c0ec0f2cfdd9,"(warning: wall of text, i'm a little overexcited, pics below :) ) last month my girlfriend and i spend 3 weeks traveling through sudan. we literally didn't meet a single other tourist, (sudan doesn't get many tourists - i believe 12.000 in the whole of 2016- and april-may is considered low-season) so i figured i'd write something about sudan here, since we had such an amazing time and we hope more people visit this amazing country. my girlfriend spend 3 months doing research on syrian refugees in sudan before i came to sudan, but she only stayed in the capital (khartoum) before. first of all, sudan is an amazing country. because of its location, its culture is very unique, i would describe it as an interesting mix between the arab world and a more west-african one. don't get put of by the fact that it's a sharia country, yes it's almost impossible to get alcohol, but apart from that we didn't really experienced any problems because of this. my girlfriend didn't even had to wear a headscarf. we felt extremely safe during our trip. the biggest plus of sudan? people are extremely friendly and also a bit introvert. we could walk through the markets and busy squares/bus stops of khartoum and other cities (my girlfriend is a tall blond girl) and people pretty much leave you be, nobody tries to sell you anything, you don't get surrounded by people at all. the people who do approach you are very polite and usually just want to say 'hi, how are you?' or 'welcome to sudan'. in an our time there we literally did not have a single intimidating or even really uncomfortable experience with the people in sudan. we got invited to weddings, dinners at peoples home and found the people on the street extremely helpful when we needed directions or instructions how to deal with public transport. the sights we visited really amazed us. sudan has more pyramides than egypt. we went to multiple sites, ruins of old temples in the desert or along the nile. most are extremely old, build by the old egyptians or even people before that, more then 3000 years ago. some of those are extremely intact, and often you can go inside as well. we saw some amazing tombs with wall paintings and hyroglifics that were in much better state than i expected. all while not seeing a single other tourist. it's quite surreal to be able to visit these sites without a single other person there, most of these sites are just laying around in the desert, without a sign, fence or office around it. you just take a car and go there, and you'll have them all for yourself. it's everything egypt has, but more, and with a lot less tourists. after our time in the desert we went to port sudan at the red sea. here we did some snorkeling, ate amazing sea food and cooled down. we also took a trip to sanganeb reef, one of the best diving locations in the red sea and according to some, in the world. the sea was light blue and i saw the most colorful and lively coral i've ever seen. again, we were the only ones there. here is my album full of pictures: if you have any questions please ask! i would recommend sudan as a travel destination 5/5, only downside to this trip is that visiting the us anytime soon will be a lot harder, but that's definitely worth it :)",none,5

98cf8840-faf1-4d98-a067-d74261bed524,"**update: i added a new daily cost estimate per country for what i would've spent if not visiting friends &amp; family or couchsurfing.** check out the daily budget further down to see. i posted this on lonely planet's thorn tree forum, but thought i'd share here too. original post on tt is i just finished transcribing my entire budget and wanted to share the results. prices are in both euro and usd, though i was budgeting in usd and the rates are not the same now as they were during the trip, so i'm converting based on rough rate at the time (€.75 to us$1). everything is rounded and somewhat estimated, so not all numbers will add up perfectly except where i copied from the spreadsheet. **fast facts:** **days on the road: 555**. that is 79 weeks, or about **18 months**, between june 2013 and december 2014. **days i recorded budget for: 488**. since i visited friends and family a few times, spent 5 weeks volunteering, and had a few layovers i didn't keep a budget for, i'm excluding those days because they’ll skew the averages. **total cost: us$40,200/€30,150** including pre-trip, flights, daily, and splurges. **costs during trip: us$20,800/€15,600** for accommodation, food, non-air transit, excursions, etc. minus splurges. **average daily: us$43/€32**, excluding splurges. **flights: us$3,600/€2,700** i'll explain this further down. **splurges: $9,200/€6,900**. scuba diving &amp; olympics in sochi, details at bottom. ... **destinations**: about 25 countries &amp; territories, counting layovers where i left the airport. basically, various countries in the pacific, south america, russia, central asia, eastern europe, western europe. **travel style:** independent, low-budget, but with balance. this means the occasional day trip, a few multi-day tours that would be harder to do otherwise, a nicer room now and then. i stayed with a number of friends and also couchsurfed, so i'll note that my daily averages were lower than expected in places. mostly, though, it was dorm rooms, cooking in hostels when in more expensive countries, public transit, carpooling, walking, and not too many drinks (aside from belgium anyway). focus on scenery, architecture, ruins, history, and getting to know people via couchsurfing and in hostels. didn't go too crazy visiting museums, did visit lots of outdoor parks and monuments. i'm vegetarian, so in some places that may have reduced my food costs, and i didn't buy many souvenirs. ... **detailed breakdown:** **pretrip gear &amp;

f7ae0e9b-2325-4081-b56e-8e845357219b,"so, this is based on 2 people (myself 31 and my wife 29) travelling around south and central america for 359 days (just shy of a year!). the reason i haven't just halved everything is because sometimes it isn't just half! quite often a double room for the two of us was cheaper than 2 dorm beds, sometimes we split meals and things like hiring mopeds were obviously cheaper because we split the cost. however, i hope this serves as a useful guide for all those poeple saying ""how much do i need to save for xxx months in xxx"" a pre-amble - we are fairly experienced travellers in that we never take tourist transport (only local chicken buses), we do all border crossing ourselves, we hitch-hike occasionally, we eat street food or cook for ourselves and we stay in cheap non-party hostels (ie we don't pay premiums for the ""cool"" hostels) which we never book - we turn up and get a hostel after wandering about a bit. we also do quite a few things ourselves - like hiking trips, ruins or lake tours - we never get the ""tours and guides"". also, we don't scuba dive (only snorkel) which is a big cost for some people however, we do drink a fair bit, we don't scrimp and save on big ticket tours that we can't do ourselves or that we actually want a guide/other tourists (inka trail, san blas desert islands trip, other boat tours) and we never ever miss out on something because we can't afford to do it. if it's expensive and we want to do it then we will do it and work the cash out budget wise later on. the reason i say all this is because the tour guides, the tourist transport, the party hostels and the fancy restaurants will obviously add a fair old chunk on to this!!! so, if that's what you're similar to then here's the breakdown which might be helpful for you. all of these are average daily spend and time in each country was between a week and 5/6 weeks. i've included a few caveats for the countries which you'll see below!

9d98b3ba-6f3e-4320-98d4-6f07721abd9a,"through the nearly 2 decades that chester bennington was in linkin park, a lot of music got made. a lot of that music never made it onto an official album release. instead, a great majority were released on yearly discs for the lp fan club, known as the lp underground. some still were released through various other means. below, in roughly chronological order, are finished (in most cases) tracks that a non-hardcore fan may not have heard before: **slip (circa 1999)** originate from when linkin park were known as xero, pre-chester. the song was redone once chester joined the band. this demo was eventually released on lpu11 in 2011. **blue (circa 1999)** is a song that the band largely considered crap. they would end up recording it, but abandoned almost all of it later. the bridge, however, the band actually liked. they took the vocals from that section, and with new words and new chords underneath, created the chorus to hybrid theory hit crawling. blue would also see release on lpu11 in 2011. **so far away (circa 1999)** [so far is the earliest instance of rapper/guitarist/pianist/bassist/producer mike shinoda singing on lead vocals, almost a decade before he would do so on minutes to midnight. the chorus is interesting in that it has mike singing with chester almost rapping his lines in a call-and-response manner, a reversal of the formula that brought linkin park to fame. so far away was released to fans on lpu12 in 2012. **dedicated (circa 1999)** is a rap-centric track written by mike leading into the hybrid theory sessions. a few interesting facts on this one: the version of dedicated that was released is censored, with the word ""shit"" being muted. this is the only version of the song that exists for public consumption. further, dedicated would be sampled in future collaboration with legendary dj group the x-ecutioners on it's goin' down. dedicated was released in 2002 on lpu2. **step up (circa 1999)** [step is a rap song that originates from the hybrid theory ep from 1999. at this point in the band's career, hybrid theory was the name of the band rather than linkin park. this would end up changing as there was an existing band named hybrid. chester would recommend the name lincoln park to the rest of the band as he passed a park by that name on his way to the studio every day. this ep was released in very limited numbers in 1999, but was eventually rereleased in 2001 for the lpu, technically making it lpu1. step up was a popular song to be played live by the band throughout their nu-metal era. the song would also later be sampled by the band on it's goin' down and reanimation track kyur4 th ich. **and one, carousel, and part of me (circa 1999)** [and and [part of are also songs from the hybrid theory ep. unlike step up, however, the band would keep these songs in consideration for their debut album, rerecording them and adding parts through the hybrid theory recording sessions. interestingly, since these are demos for the album hybrid theory but also got an official release on the hybrid theory ep the year earlier, you get an interesting scenario where the ""demo versions"" of these three songs are actually more recent than the ""official releases."" i've linked the demo versions in this post. these were included in demo cds to get word out about the band. speaking of demo cds... **she couldn't (circa 1999)** [she was a track found on a hybrid theory demo cd. it's a clear indicator that, even as they were developing their breakout nu-metal sound, linkin park were willing to experiment with drastically different sounds. she couldn't is softer, vocally, than anything that could be heard at this point from chester, and featured a sparse guitar lead and a synth breakdown. it was included on an 8-track demo to distribute for internal use or as promo material. she couldn't holds the distinction of being one of the longer songs linkin park has ever written, clocking in over 5 minutes in length. this would not be beat by a non-remix track until 2006. as it stands, the only songs that clock in at a longer duration by the band are the little things give you away off minutes to midnight, the catalyst off a thousand suns, guilty all the same off the hunting party, and a line in the sand off the same album. this song did not see official release, presumably due to sampling b-boy document '99 by high &amp; mighty. you might know that track from tony hawk pro skater 2. she couldn't went undiscovered by linkin park fans until copies of this promo cd showed up on ebay in 2009. **regarding 1999 demo cds: the above demo cds also include early demo versions of songs like in the end, crawling, a place for my head, and points of authority that end up on the hybrid theory album. some of them are vastly different than the version we got. i'm not going to write them up here since they ended up on a studio album, but feel free to go listen to them yourself!** **qwerty (circa 2006)** was written and recorded during the sessions for minutes to midnight. it came about due to the band wanting to debut a new song for their shows in japan in 2006. the band had actually been planning to play a song with the working title grecian, but last minute decided to scrap it and write a new song instead. thus, qwerty was born. after the japan shows in august, the band would record the song and release it on lpu6 that december. **chance of rain (circa 2006)** [chance of is one of many tracks that did not make the cut for 2007 album minutes to midnight. it's on the mellow side of what linkin park were producing in this period. mike shinoda stated that the song did not make the cut due to the band feeling like there were too many mid-tempo songs being considered for the album, like leave out all the rest, in between, or valentine's day. chance of rain was released on lpu15 in 2015. **across the line (circa 2007)** [across the is another song that did not make the cut for 2007 album minutes to midnight. under the working title japan, this song can be heard being demoed out in the accompanying dvd for that album. it holds the distinction of being the last song to be cut from the album of all the songs that were recorded during this period. across the line was released to the lp underground on lpu9. **blackbirds (circa 2007)** is yet another song that did not make the cut for minutes to midnight. this song made it far enough into the recording process to have orchestral strings arranged by david campbell recorded for them. the song was ""released"" as part of linkin park mobile game 8-bit rebellion! (sic) in 2010. **no roads left (circa 2007)** [no roads is, you guessed it, a song that was cut from minutes to midnight. this is probably the most well-known of this batch, as it was a bonus track on some editions of that album. recording of this song can be seen in the making of minutes to midnight dvd, where chester and mike tell the story of how chester insisted that mike's voice was better for the song. **what we don't know (circa 2007)** [what we don't is, well, look at the year and figure it out. despite reaching the mixing stage of the album recordings (it was mixed by neal avron, who mixed the entirety of minutes to midnight), the song is considered unfinished by the band. what we don't know was released on lpux in 2010. **pretend to be (circa 2006-2008)** [pretend to began as a song from the minutes to midnight recording sessions, but would be reworked and re-recorded in 2008. the song has a rarity for lp tracks, an instrumental breakdown outro that reduces to drum and bass before building back up. pretend to be was released on lpux in 2010. **i have not begun (circa 2009)** [i have not is a mike shinoda-centric rap song that was recorded during the sessions for album a thousand suns. the track was built around recordings of mike creating a static buzz by touching a gauge cable with his finger while plugged into an amp. i have not begun was released on lpux in 2010. **not alone (circa 2006-2010)** [not originates from the minutes to midnight sessions. it was untouched for a few years until the catastrophic earthquake that hit haiti in 2010. the band, who runs the charity music for relief, worked with other artists to create the compilation album download to donate for haiti. people were encouraged to either download the compilation with proceeds going to relief efforts, or to donate to relief efforts. other artists who contributed to this album were slash, peter gabriel, alanis morissette, dinosaur jr., and more. the album was released in january 2010 and raised $270,000. **primo (circa 2010)** was a song that began during recording sessions for 2010 album a thousand suns. it would later be reworked into [i'll be a song featured on 2012 album living things. among the hardcore lp fanbase, primo is considered to be highly superior to i'll be gone. this demo would see release in 2013 on lpuxiii. **the last line (circa 2007-2014)** [the last began as a demo titled ""ammosick"" during the minutes to midnight recordings. vocally, it is a mike shinoda-centric song and definitely has elements that date it to those 2007 sessions. despite not being considered for that album (though it reached the mixing stage of that album), the song idea would persist with the band, as evidenced from their meeting of a thousand suns documentary. at one point, a song board can be seen with titles of songs being considered/worked on, including the last line. the song would be used by linkin park's dj, joe hahn's directorial debut mall. while the last line is credited as ammosick in the film, the official soundtrack release that came in 2014 finalizes the title. **devil's drop (circa 2011-2014)** [devil's was created during the recording sessions for 2012 album living things. like the last line, it features mike shinoda taking lead vocals and playing the guitar loop that forms the basis of the song. the guitar loop was recorded on an iphone so that mike would not forget it, and thus features background chatter from the rest of the band. devil's drop was also released in 2014 for the mall soundtrack. **it goes through (circa 2011-2014)** [it goes is another song from the batch of living things demos that end up on the mall soundtrack. like the other two songs we've seen from this soundtrack, the song is largely mike shinoda on vocals, though chester is (along with the other two) credit as a writer. **white noise (circa 2012-2014)** [white is the sole chester-centric song off the mall soundtrack. not much is known about the origins of this one. as it was recorded for mall, it existed in some for at least by 2012. the lyrics of the song can be seen in youtube videos documenting the launch of 2014 album the hunting party. fittingly for that album's style, white noise has a dirtier, guitar-based instrumental than the other 3 mall songs. it would be released for free download by linkin park in 2014. **what are you worth (circa 2016)** what are you worth is a demo from the one more light sessions. it is a mike-centric song, and is decidely more rock-focused than other songs from those sessions. what are you worth was leaked to the public in 2019. there is no link for this song largely because it was not meant for release and i would like respect the band and label's wishes to not share this song. **looking for an answer (circa 2017)** [looking for an is, as of today, the last song written for/under the name of linkin park. this song does not exist in album form, and was written by mike shinoda after chester

c6c79582-d628-4561-8b43-ecdba8739c30,"dear all, yesterday something happened in our state, to be precise, the very next day after the ""cattle ban for slaughter "" and the first day of the holy month of ramadan. a temple was found desecrated on saturday near nilambur (district of malappuram) . the doors of the main sanctum and the idols inside were found broken. this was almost immediately followed by a hartal by hindu aikya vedi. the protesters tried to block the way of shri. aryadan muhammed , former congress mla and former minister of electricity who was there to visit the place. next was the commencement of a direct and a social media campaign urging hindus to be ready to open refugee camps across southern districts of kerala. there were rumors of possible muslim involvement. but fortunately nothing happened according to the plan of the instigators. this was due to a timely intervention of the kerala police department who caught the perpetrator within 24 hours. the accused is rajaram mohandas, a trivandrum resident. according to him, he did this to protest against bad customs in the hindu religion. not a believable story at all. someone traveled more than 350 kms just to protest against bad customs. he just by co-incidence chose the district with the largest muslim population. the beginning of ramadan is another co-incidence, cattle ban law is yet another one.. a series of unfortunate co-incidences. you get the idea, don't you? the timely action of our police is really commendable. equally appreciated is the maturity and composure shown by the hindu brothers and sisters of malappuram who did not jump to conclusions based on rumors and cooked up stories. unfortunately, this is not the first incident of its kind. cooked up stories have become the cause or have sparked major riots. you can find numerous examples of similar incidents all across the country. here is a small example... prior to the gujarat riots, a local newspaper reported an incident, a story about how the bodies of two hindu women were found on the banks of a river. two days later the newspaper disawowed the story in a small column in a not so noticable place. but the damage was done. it fueled cruelty towards women during the ensuing riots but incidents like this are new to us. we are not familiar with the purposeful spreading of lies to create a split among people of different religions and to benefit from it politically and financially. so it is both shocking and sad to say that the gap between these kinds of incidents is becoming shorter. what they are trying to do is obvious to us. willfully spreading false information among the people - depicting different districts of kerala as ""pakistan"" and ""china"" of kerala, the state president of bjp openly lying on twitter, spreading misinformation about the population of kerala and the real estate business in malappuram etc are different acts in this big political drama. to add to this, there is also a smear campaign going on against the state of kerala itself. if anybody feels that nothing of this sort will happen, if some innocent souls remain doubtful, let me ask them something. four years back, did anyone think that one fine morning, all 1000 &amp; 500 currency notes would become useless and the whole country would be asked to stand in a ""queue"" to show patriotism? by the way, did anyone know about the 'actual' loss and/ or gains of demonetization? you might remember the first man attacked and killed in the name of ""beef"". you might not remember those who were killed after because these incidents have lost their news value. cows were here long before we got our freedom and they have been here for almost 69 years after. and nothing of this kind has happened ever before. if this now has become normal for you my friend... did anyone imagine in their wildest dreams that the list of the names of students and writers who have disappeared would become this long? the answer is obvious... all these plans are to create insecurity in the minds of the majority. the majority should feel insecure, that they are denied justice, and that they will be overpowered and outnumbered by the minority in the immediate future. then they will enter the scene as the heroes to save the ""majority in distress"" fortunately kerala was able to avoid a communal riot. but the state saw a new kind of politics. politics of lies. politics trying to create split and violence to gain power and to be in power. we are thankful to the people of kerala and the efficient police department for keeping the peace and unity of kerala even after repeated attempts to disrupt this harmony. is there any way to avoid the obvious? answer is yes. and it is very simple too. 1. do not jump to conclusions. if someone says that ""hindus are not allowed to venture out to the attingal sea"", first ask is it true or at least ask does attingal have a sea or a beach or at least a lagoon. 2. if someone poses as your savior or of your religion, first think who will have the ultimate gain. you or him? if a leader tells you to go and kill someone for hindutva/ christianity/ islam, first think is it for him or for the betterment of ""said religion"". 3. we are educated for a reason. ask for the source of facts and figures. try to understand the truth. most importantly, build and nourish relationships. no one - neither some leader in delhi nor the lok sabha or anywhere else can replace your immediate neighbor in the time of need. at least share a smile. say a 'hi'. little things like these build bonds. only that can resist fascism. these are bad times. if we need a better india, we must be vigilant. be warned, these incidents will keep on happening.. thank you. love and regards, from kerala dr nelson joseph",none,5

f173b5ab-1c95-4a6e-b957-b22e639b5fee,"every so often there's a post in here from a frustrated backpacker. it's either, ""just got back from a solo trip and i didn't enjoy it"" or ""been here 4 days and haven't made any friends, yet."" i think that part of the blame falls on dudes like me saying shit like, ""man, solo travel is so much better. just buy a fuckin' book and go."" without a disclaimer. so here's my disclaimer: **contrary to what matador network purports, you're not making new friends every 20 minutes and every night in the hostel is not a slightly smellier version of mardi gras.** for every hostel where you make temporary bffs and have the time of your life there's another that sucks donkey balls. maybe it's empty. maybe the people inside are all turds or it's just plain boring. i was once at a hostel in aberdeen, scotland and it was saturday night. i really wanted to go out for drinks but there was just one other guy in the place from denmark (it was the dead of winter in, well, aberdeen, scotland)...anyhow, i said ""hey man, let's go out."" ""i can't. i have a flight on monday and i don't want to be tired."" ""but today's saturday? where are you flying to."" ""copenhagen."" i repeat. not every night in the hostel is a slightly smellier version of mardi gras. **long solo bus/train/plane trips can be boring...mind numbingly boring** this pain point of solo travel is less of an issue in our device friendly wifi on the bus world but it's still worth noting. solo travel involves some very lonely times even if you're super gregarious and a poster child for the extroverts. in conjunction with my first point, there are times you might go 2-3 days without having a proper conversation. solo travel is awesome and you will make amazing friendships but you'd also better be cool with chilling out with [me, myself and too. **sometimes you hang out with idiots** just like your mate who ""takes the grenade"" as your wingman at the bar, there are times on the road where your choice of travel mates is so slim that you wind up spending quality time with people you don't really care for. think of it as paying your dues for the times you literally make friends with people you wish could be in your life forever. not every travel connection is a match made in heaven...sometimes it's a match made in ""i guess you'll do for a trip to the museum."" **you do need to work at it** even if you're incredibly good looking and charming like me, you need to stand up and go talk to people if you want to make friends. the hostel isn't a matchmaking service so if you sit in the corner and read your book or match candies on your phone you'll likely still be sitting there alone doing the same at midnight while everyone else is out doing the boogie-woogie. take the initiative to say hello or else. making friends is a verb. **tips for getting it done** - to minimize your alone time, research hostels ahead of time. read reviews and look for social cues, not cleanliness. hint: often the dodgiest hostels are the best for making friends. - take guided tours. i don't mean g adventures. i mean day tours, 2-3 day treks, stuff where you're doing something in a group. even if it costs $20 more to take the guided snorkel trip versus renting gear on the beach, there's a good chance you'll make a friend when you're stuck for 4 hours on a rickety boat with 5 strangers. - go to the bar solo. not for everyone, but hey, if i'm feeling lonely a tourist bar and a few pints of courage is a surefire recipe for concocting a table of mates. do your best to avoid the whole american football vs. rugby conversation, it's a waste of time for all parties involved. with solo travel the highs are higher and the lows are lower, so remember that before you head out on your first solo adventure. give it time...go with the flow...enjoy your alone time because in 'real life' it's not all that often you get a full 24 hours to your thoughts. remember that when people recount their travels and it sounds like it was a non-stop love fest with the greatest people on earth that they're often highlighting 20 days out of a 3-month trip. and hey, solo travel isn't for everyone so that's ok, too. you don't have to like it. edit: very good points being made that alone time can also been seen as a positive and not a negative. i'm not trying to say being alone is bad but specifically gearing that portion of my rant towards those who perhaps weren't expecting so much alone time when all you hear are the stories when you're not alone. point also taken that not everyone who travels solo is looking to meet a ton of people nor is every solo traveler staying in hostels - but clearly these sorts of travelers aren't the type who are disappointed when they aren't making as many connections/friends as they thought they would.",none,5

65206a88-9dc7-4b32-9bb5-ee0238d67deb,"i would like to show the actually breakdown of where the money goes across a variety of different music distribution platforms, so you can decide for yourself what is fair, and what is not. i decided to publicly publish all my financial information for the past year. i am an independent musician, that creates instrumental guitar music. i am not bringing home the big bucks, but i feel i have enough information to give an accurate financial depiction. i have all the charts and screenshots published in an imgur link at the bottom of this post. if you check them out and believe that i am missing some valuable insight, please let me know and i can edit that information into this post. let us begin. i get my stats from the service distrokid. please do not think this is just an ad for distrokid, it s not. in fact, the reporting analytics are piss poor, which only allows me to give insight towards itunes and spotify. i can see the earnings from all the other services, but don’t have any stats streams/downloads etc. **itunes**. for every sale on itunes i keep 77% of the sale. so $0.77 cents per song. i feel that is pretty fair for a behemoth such as apple. not much more to it than that, pretty straight forward. **bandcamp** is a bit more complex. they say they take 15% as their cut from each sale, but after all the paypal fees, it comes out to be much less. when somebody buys my album of of bandcamp for $5.00, i get $3.90 in my paypal account. that is 78%, about the same as itunes. important to note however, the more somebody pays for an album the more this percentage goes up. if somebody pays $10 for an album, i get 8.06, so about 80%, but more or less the same. i offer my music for free on bandcamp, with the option to pay. this is just a personal preference, and i believe it fosters a better community of sharing and creation. my revenue from bandcamp (from my 2 album sales, not including individual song sales) has been $1,025. from that, 619 people downloaded them for free, and 160 decided to pay. if you break it down by revenue from total downloads, it comes out to be $1.31 per album. of those who decided to pay, the average price that was chosen was $6.40. for the time being, i will continue to offer my music for free on bandcamp. i believe if people want it they will download it anyway, and i rather be in control of the channels that they are getting it from. now for the streaming. **spotify**. all in all i have had 176,548 streams on spotify, which has yielded $706.02. this comes out to be $.004 a stream. this means for every million streams the artist gets paid $4,000. **youtube**. i believe this is the biggest competitor to spotify. from 356,064 streams on youtube, i have yielded $145.55. this is with every fucking ad option selected. that comes out to be $.0004 per stream. this comes out to be $400 per million streams. also, keep in mind that a lot of the music on youtube is not on the artist's channels, in which case they are getting nothing. unfortunately distrokid analytics are not that great, so i can not provide any insight on the following services, but i can show you how much i made from each. i would be really interested to see the stream sats for tidal and google play and apple music, to see how they relate to spotify. i will update everybody as soon as distrokid gets their shit together and i can report it. * itunes: $198.80 * itunes match: $0.29 * apple music: $36.44 * spotify: $706.02 * pandora: $0.33 * deezer: $0.86 * tidal: $5.49 * yt music: $1.00 * groove streaming: $0.09 * groove downloads: $0.70 * google play: $8.04 * google play all access: $14.03 * amazon: $28.26 i'll leave with this information and decide for yourself the best way to support artists. when i get updated statistics i will post them. again, don’t think this is an ad for distrokid. if anything this is a thinly veiled attempt to draw attention to my music by offering you something of value in return. i will also give you my opinion on the state of music. the music industry is far from dead, it just needs to adapt. i get so annoyed by musicians bitching about how they don’t get paid enough when comparing it to ten years ago. i heard someone say “i am getting paid fractions of a cent fort someone to hear my song, when they used to buy it for a dollar.” that

3971879f-3ab7-47c4-b98a-ba504113dc21,"i wanted to write a little bit about wow, since i see frequent questions on here about whether the airline is safe/comfortable/really as cheap as advertised. additionally, since it's now expanding to the west coast and to more connecting cities, more people are likely to ask in the future. in september, i was having a bad day so i impulse-bought two tickets on wow to paris (cdg) via reykjavik for $330 apiece. holy shit. by comparison, the cheapest available flight to paris on my dates was $599 with turkish with one stop in istanbul. the cheapest non-stop was $715 with air france in early january. so wow offered a good deal. here's how it all went. **price**: wow air follows the low-cost model of spirit or frontier, a low base fare with additional fees for seat selection, baggage, and meals. with the purchase of extra-legroom seats and carry-on baggage, i paid an additional $198, bringing the total cost of my tickets to $429 each. this is still about $170 cheaper than the turkish flight, plus wow had a shorter, more convenient layover. additionally, on the red-eye from bos to kef, i chose the xl legroom seats at $38 apiece, an unnecessary luxury. on that note ... **seats:** in terms of seating, flying wow is basically the same as flying easyjet abroad or most of the legacy carriers in the u.s. wow operates a fleet of a320s and a321s with standard three-by-three seating in a single coach-class config. this is a plane that everyone has taken at some point and is perfectly fine. legroom was fine at around 31 inches standard. the xl seats i booked (1a and 1b) were 34 or 35 inches and were insanely, almost unnecessarily roomy. row 2 on the right side of the plane was even roomier, with near-business-class legroom. if you're pau gasol tall, consider spending the extra $38 to $48 for these seats. otherwise, standard legroom should be fine. **baggage**: wow sets strict weight and dimensions limits for carry-on baggage, and the free 5 kg you're allowed may not be sufficient for a long trip. i paid $38 each way for an additional 7 kg of carry-on allowance (that's 12 kg total, or 26 lbs). this was more than enough for 10 days in europe. no one measured my bag's dimensions, but it was weighed at check-in both in boston and in paris, and the desk seemed pretty strict on weight limits. my general pro-tips: invest in a lightweight carry-on like [it and buy yourself a luggage scale. my luggage scale even has a level in it. how useful for those household fixing things i never do! most of my fellow travelers seemed to be students or backpackers who also stuck to the carry-on limits, plus a few naive flyers with suitcases the size of a garden shed. (were they planning on smuggling sheep out of iceland?) as with all low-cost carriers, checking bags is expensive and can probably be avoided. **check-in**: wow air doesn't offer mobile check-in at this time, so you'll have to head to the airport about two or three hours ahead of time to get your boarding pass and seat assignment, if you haven't reserved a seat prior. in boston, there was no line at 3:30 for a 5:45 flight. in paris' dull and antiseptic terminal 3, the line was rather long but moved quickly. we were through in a half-hour. at check-in, you will weigh your bags and receive paper boarding passes. these are annoying and i always lose them in airport bathrooms. consider stapling to your person. **boarding**: in boston, we boarded back to front, which was a little bothersome, both being in row 1 and seeing how many flyers had carry-on bags. however, there was plenty of room in the overhead compartment for my bag, so my fear was unwarranted, like most of my fears (hostile takeovers, bears). for our connection to paris and for both flights returning to the u.s., we boarded shuttles that took us to the hinterlands of keflavik and degaulle's runways (a trademark of low-cost flying). boarding was a goddamn free-for-all once everyone got off the bus, like a horde of moms descending on a kohl's on black friday. fair warning: waiting in a bus at 4 a.m. in iceland while maintenance refuels a plane is pretty unpleasant. i was sleepy and cold and a little annoyed, but life is filled with small miseries. **in-flight experience**: as noted, the seats were reasonably comfortable, with decent width and legroom and slightly stiff padding. seats have electrical outlets but no seatback entertainment. i'm ok with this after a recent jal flight in which i watched ""tammy"" three times, in japanese, out of desperation. wow also offers ipad rentals, if you reach that same level of desperation, or you could just bring your own book or whatever. several times throughout the trip, flight attendants came by with the snack cart, offering sandwiches, chips, drinks, etc. food seemed reasonably priced; however, menu prices are in icelandic isk so check the exchange rate before you get off the ground. i didn't eat anything onboard, but it seemed that quite a few people around us did. pro-tip: skyr is not available on flights departing from the u.s. so if you want to satisfy that sweet skyr itch, you'll have to wait until your return flight. in general, the plane is fine in a no-frills, bright and bubbly kind of way. wow's brand marketing team obviously went to some trouble to make the in-flight collateral (sick bags, signage) cheeky and cute. the staff was professional and prompt and heart sinkingly attractive. speaking of. **skuli:** wow's ceo is named skuli and he's hot as fuck. [look at be jealous of skuli. **conclusion**: wow doesn't have swish safety videos or mood lighting or business class or in-flight meals. there are some small cost-cutting annoyances, like lengthy boarding procedures and departures from the least desirable parts of the airport, where a hudson news is but a distant dream. but what wow *does* have is dirt-cheap transatlantic flights. getting to paris for $300+ was unheard of before this. in fact, flying is getting pretty affordable with wow and others like them (norwegian air, xl airways) entering the u.s. that's a good thing, as long as you don't expect first-class-on-emirates treatment at frontier prices. overall, my flight was pleasant in an utterly standard way. it was comfortable and cheap and i was in boston one day and in paris by 11 a.m. the next, all for $400 and a slight butt cramp. who could argue? i would fly wow again, simply because wow has a good product and good prices. and also skuli. wow has skuli.",none,5

there’s actually a lot more going on there than i knew back in the late ‘90s when it was all over the radio. key to my newfound appreciation of it is reading the lyrics, most of which i couldn’t actually make out just from listening. here they are, in their entirety: &gt; it ain't no joke, i'd like to buy the world a toke &gt; and teach the world to sing in perfect harmony &gt; and teach the world to snuff the fires and the liars &gt; hey, i know it's just a song but it's spice for the recipe &gt; this is a love attack, i know, went out but it's back &gt; it's just like any fad, it retracts before impact &gt; and just like fashion, it's a passion for the with it and hip &gt; if you got the goods, they'll come and buy it just to stay in the clique &gt; so don't delay, act now, supplies are running out &gt; allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive &gt; and if you follow, there may be a tomorrow &gt; but if the offer’s shunned, you might as well be walkin' on the sun &gt; twenty-five years ago, they spoke out and they broke out &gt; of recession and oppression and together they toked &gt; and they folked out with guitars around a bonfire &gt; just singin' and clappin', man, what the hell happened there? &gt; some were spellbound, some were hellbound &gt; some, they fell down and some got back up &gt; and fought back against the meltdown &gt; and their kids were hippie chicks or hypocrites &gt; because fashion is smashin' the true meaning of it &gt; so don't delay, act now, supplies are running out &gt; allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive &gt; and if you follow, there may be a tomorrow &gt; but if the offer’s shunned, you might as well be walkin' on the sun &gt; and it ain't no joke when a mama's handkerchief is soaked &gt; with her tears because her baby's life has been revoked &gt; the bond is broke up, so choke up and focus on the close up &gt; mr. wizard can't reform, no god-like hocus-pocus &gt; so don't sit back, kick back and watch the world get bushwhacked &gt; news at ten, your neighborhood is under attack &gt; put away the crack before the crack puts you away &gt; you need to be there when your baby's old enough to relate &gt; so don't delay, act now, supplies are running out &gt; allow, if you're still alive, six to eight years to arrive &gt; and if you follow, there may be a tomorrow &gt; but if the offer’s shunned, you might as well be walkin' on the sun i’m not saying it’s dylan, but those lyrics are much more clever and intricate than they appear on first listen. reading the lyrics also gives me the impression that the song is less cynical and sarcastic than i originally thought. i used to think it was just making fun of hippies, and how baby boomers abandoned their principles, and how the hippie movement was co-opted into a fashion statement. but giving it a closer look, the singer sounds genuinely sad and angry that we’ve forgotten the ideals behind the fashion. i completely missed the meaning of the lines, “and if you follow, there may be a tomorrow / but if the offer’s shunned, you might as well be walkin’ on the sun.” maybe i’m reading too much into it, but to me this sounds less dismissive and more apocalyptic. i don’t know if he’s talking about global thermonuclear war or global warming, or both, but the impression i get from these lines is: the hippie ethos of peace and love and living in harmony with the earth is not just nice to think about; it’s necessary for our survival as a species. and if we as a society don’t reconnect with that, we will *literally destroy ourselves*. and these fuckers turned it into a meaningless fashion statement and sold it back to us as new beetles and flared jeans, and now the only remnant of this incredibly vital counterculture is more widespread use of substances that *destroy people’s lives*. i mean, that’s fucking horrible! and seeing those lines that way casts new light on the part, “allow, if you’re still alive...” i used to think that was just making fun of baby boomers for being old, and/or the endless cycle of old fads becoming cool again. but in light of “and if you follow, there may be a tomorrow,” it sounds more like a warning. funnily enough, it’s now been almost 25 years since this song was released. and the ice caps are melting at a terrifyingly fast rate and we are, thanks to trump, once again perilously close to nuclear war. and we’re all kind of avoiding thinking about it by drowning ourselves in exactly the sort of distractions this song is about (drugs, consumerism, etc.). the hippies’ offer was definitively shunned, and now we’re closer than ever to our own destruction. this is a surprisingly good song, man. it’s catchy, well-crafted, and well-written, with something to say and actual relevance to our time. laugh at me all you want, but i’ve got genuine respect for smash mouth right now. also, the first person to comment “somebody once told me” is getting downvoted so hard their grandchildren will lose karma. edit: added formatting for clarity.",none,5

1142af91-63dc-4992-b108-7d68296c93aa,"so you’ve plowed through a few buzzfeed articles, drooled over your mates’ photos on facebook and are all bonered up to embark on your very first international adventure. sweet. but how much is this bad boy going to cost? if you’ve never gone it’s hard to tell. that hipster barista outside of whole foods told you that he traveled for 6 months on 3 grand but then bob barker says that 5 days/6 nights in rome runs $5,329 and that was in bloody 1987. so who’s right? both of them (potentially). the problem is that you neither want to travel like [this guy]( nor [this lady]( – you want the standard hostel-going, beer swilling, make out with some foreigners and have a good time while seeing some ‘old shit’ to get cultured experience. here’s a quick guide to help you figure out a reasonable budget that’s right for you. *disclaimer*: i am talking about budgeting a “budget” trip (i.e. paying for low-end lodging and transport) and not true shoestring travel. these tips do not account for helpx, wwoofing, busking, begging, couchsurfing, hitchhiking, free camping or similar radical cost-cutting measures. i have no experience with this stuff and don’t purport to. **be wary of anyone else’s budget** think of any “how much does it cost?” type question. from buying clothes to food to cars, computers and more, everyone’s got a different idea of what they like and/or expect for their money. one person might spend $5.99 + tax at happy teriyaki because they drink the free tea, pass on the spring roll and pocket the change instead of tossing it into the tip jar. the next guy adds a coke plus an order of gyoza before tipping his change plus a crisp george washington. person a says happy teriyaki costs 6 bucks, person b says 10…it’s almost exactly the same product. and we’re not even talking about person c who cooks shitty teriyaki at home for $1.50 and person d who drops $100 at benihana’s instead. it’s the same with travel. personal tastes are always going to guarantee that your travel style will never match up with someone else – you’re always going to be comparing apples to oranges, so take anyone else’s budget with a grain of salt and research costs on your own. other people’s budgets are great for a guideline. for a starting point. for determining a basic range to begin your analysis. if the general consensus is that destination x costs $20-$50/day this is a great starting point…but always take the time to figure out where your desires lie along that spectrum, don’t automatically presume you can do it for the lower number just because you hate your fucking job and just want to go. **outline the experience you’re after** along these same lines, you can’t start to budget until you get a picture in your head of what you expect your trip/experience to look like. do you see yourself ziplining by day and clubbing by night or do you see yourself reading a book in the park and spending most of your time just wandering around checking shit out? if you budget for the wrong experience you could wind up severely disappointed as your hostel mates are heading out to the bar and you’re stuck in the room counting pennies. i really can’t stress enough that most people traveling on a crazy tight budget are living an experience that truly isn’t suited for most people. a lot of people in /r/travel think i’m bagging on shoestring travelers when i say this but i’m really not…what i’m bagging on is people taking extremely minimalist trips and then telling others that they’re getting the exact same experience. **make a spreadsheet** if you’re serious about budgeting and don’t want to fly by the seat of your pants, make a spreadsheet. it doesn’t have to be fancy (unless you plan on later uploading it to /r/travel for what the kids these days call “that sweet, sweet karma”) so don’t waste time on formatting and all that jazz. start with the big fixed costs – which is primarily your flight but could include train passes, etc. my own personal belief when it comes to flights is to buy the ticket just as soon as the price is “in the ballpark” and then just stop looking at prices full stop…yes, there are charts and graphs and theories for buying x number of days before your flight or whatever but in my experience the price is just as likely to go up as it is to go down…once you have determined where you want to go and when, start following prices, when they hit an acceptable price just buy the damn ticket. the euphoria of making the trip real instead of imaginary is well worth the $79 you may or may not save by waiting. the potential money you ""lost"" is easily overshadowed by all those extra months of having that cold hard ticket in your hands (metaphorically, speaking). even if you’re planning on going where the wind takes you, map out a basic itinerary so that you can list the nights of your trip one by one in your budget (or week by week if you’re going for 3 months or more)…you can change your mind as you go but i find it’s best to list every day of your trip (even if it’s hypothetical) in order to best figure out transport/activities costs along the way and account for differing costs in lodging. once a location for every day of your trip is plugged into the spreadsheet, determine a cost for lodging. if you actually book your lodging then go ahead and throw in the number you paid or agreed to pay, but if you haven’t actually made a reservation it’s best to use the average cost over the range you consider reasonable. for example, if a dorm bed in berlin runs $15-$25, plug in $20 until you’ve got an actual booking – you can’t plan on there always being space in the cheapest place. go through the entire trip and plug a number in for each night…go ahead and leave a zero if you’re planning on taking a night bus/train to save on accommodation for a night. next, make a column for transportation…and for every change of location plug a number in for what it costs to get there…whatever number you find online, add 20%...transport costs never go down, only up…if you buy a ticket in advance then of course you can put the actual cost in…but people often forget to add the little extras that come with moving locales…maybe your bus leaves so early you have to take a taxi to the station, for example? then go back and figure a realistic number for food. of course you’ll be guesstimating based on information you find online…which is why you need to use the idea of being realistic. be honest with yourself about how often you’ll be happy to cook and how often you’d like to eat out and try the local food. clearly there is street food and pb&amp;j but just be reasonable. don’t put $5/day for food just because it’s “possible” to survive on that. same goes for basic spending money…again, be honest about how many souvenirs you want to buy, how happy you are with walking/buses versus taxis, how often you want to go out drinking and what percentage of your trip you’ll be cool wandering or hanging out and how much you need to be “doing stuff” to be happy. the point here is that the old $x/day multiplied by the number of days is a good way to get a starting number to compare with but that you really need to map it all out on a spreadsheet to get a closer approximation for your specific trip. i mean, of course part of budget travel involves making adjustments along the way…big night out that cost you 4 days worth of spending money? sure, you might have to force yourself to eat ramen for 3 days and catch up on email to even things out…but if your budget is so low that you never account for those “woops, that cost more than i thought it would” situations then problems arise and it stops being fun. **big ticket items** whether it’s the machu picchu trek or one uber-fancy dinner in paris, we all have big ticket items we’d like to experience where we forego the budget and just pay the price. run through your trip and add in the cost of this big stuff separately from your spending money. it’s cliché, but you do only live once so just #yolo in the stuff that’s most important to you and forget about the cost (within reason, of course.) **add 20%** whatever the total number is that you come up with add 20% as contingency money (not counting your flight). shit happens. to everyone. particularly on your first trip. so plan for it. from getting sick to getting stuck in a hotel when all the dorms are full to an expensive taxi ride you didn’t plan on needing to buying more shit than you’d planned, drinking more than you’d planned, etc. everyone spends more on their first trip – for one thing being “good” at budget travel takes experience. at the very least make sure this extra money is available if you need it. if you wind up not using it, that’s awesome, now you won’t be totally broke when you get home – but do plan on “what if i go over budget?” ahead of time. **the numbers don’t lie** if you come to a total number and it seems way off, be wary of tweaking the numbers too much. it’s ok to go back over and see where you can trim (cut an activity – lower your expectations for spending money – slide more days into cheaper places – opt to prebook into the cheapest hostels and so forth) but don’t fudge the numbers just so they look better. this doesn’t really help you. the best way to cut costs once you’ve already planned on being a budget traveler is to shorten the length of your trip. while many will disagree, i personally think that a better course of action to make a 4 month trip cheaper is not to try and work along the way but instead trim to 3 months. your mileage may vary on this one and like i said at the beginning, my idea behind this post is primarily targeted at people who don’t want to work for room/board on their vacation. do read articles on how to travel cheap and look for tips and tricks, both in general and for specific places, but don’t toss your calculations in the trash because the barista’s number of $3,000 looks more appealing. one more thing...i skimmed over travel insurance because i have never bought it. many people will say it's a necessity - others will disagree...but add this in with your flight if it's something you want to get. edit: i will totally admit that i was in the process of setting up a public google sheets template that people could use with their own data and then i got lazy, haha. but here comes /u/stovetopluddite to save the day. it's not downloadable but exactly what i am referring to: scratch that: [here is a usable",none,5

the west coast of caspian sea. i decided to share a version of this with a smaller off-topic offshoot of /r/cfb. someone there suggested i eventually turn those posts into a big post for /r/travel and, after checking with the mods here, i've put them together with more organization and detail. the mods here said i could've posted it as it was, but i wanted add better depth/context as well as

contents, just ctrl-f what's in the parenthesis below to jump to a section: 1. intro (sec1) 1. baku's old city (sec2) 1. baku general sights (sec3) 1. outside baku (sec4) 1. food (sec5) 1. cars (sec6) 1. final thoughts (sec7) quick intro about me and my perspective: i've been traveling internationally since i was 2 months old, been to 6 continents, and have a passion for int'l relations (b.a.) and i'm a lawyer (j.d.) in my 30s in the usa. i only speak english fluently. this was my first major international trip in several years thanks to kids (who did not come along). *** ###(1) intro (sec1) *** azerbaijan's a country of about 10m people (azerbaijanis, commonly shortened to azeris), 4m of which live around the capital (baku), in an area about the size of the us state of maine (or between serbia and austria). as far as geopolitics are concerned, it has one of the more complex situations in the world, so i want to give you a quick introduction that i will expand on in the photos. ##a brief history of azerbaijan located on the western shore of the caspian sea and into the caucuses, the area's been inhabited from at least the upper stone age: many empires have occupied the area from the persians to the romans to the ottomans to the ussr. in between there have been people who have vanished (the albanians, not related to the current country of albania and pronounced slightly differently: alban-ia vs. alba-nia) as well as many smaller communities mixed into the complex jumble known as the caucuses. the present majority population is turkic and can trace it's roots to the [turkic that swept from the east ahead of the mongols. its population historically practices shia islam though, thanks to 70 years of soviet rule, the azeris are arguably one of the most secular majority muslim countries in the world, if not *the* most. things like alcohol and pork are not only permitted but, thanks to the influence of russian culture, enjoyed by a fair number of people. indeed, azerbaijan is influenced by neighbors turkey, russia, and iran in language (azerbaijani, which is most related to turkish) and culture. it also borders georgia and armenia (more on the latter below). azerbaijan has historically been known as both the land of wind (especially near the caspian) and, more importantly, the “land of fire”/“land of eternal flame”: the area around baku (the beak-shaped [absheron is *saturated* with oil and gas to the point that the ground would light on fire since ancient times—needless to say, early man saw a lot to worship, most notably zoroastrians who worship the elements (the pre-christian religion still exists in some pockets, notably mumbai). the fire theme carries itself throughout, most visibly in the [state the world's first oil boom took place around baku in the second half of the 19th century, with industrialists like the nobels and rothschilds making vast sums of money. by the 1890s *half the world's oil* came from this area and the locals built what were considered modern (for the time) buildings on the outside of the old city to celebrate their newfound wealth—you can draw an interesting parallel with the boom in the gulf states (uae, qatar, etc) today. the first offshore oil rigs were built in the caspian in what is now known as the [oil an offshore city what was used, along with baku, in the james bond flick “the world is not enough.” the collapse of the russian empire during wwi led to to 3 years of an independent liberal democracy before the red army rolled back in to make the country part of the ussr. to understand azerbaijan's importance to the soviet union, during wwii over 4/5 of the high quality fuel was coming from the oil fields around baku, making them a prime target for hitler's army before it was halted at stalingrad. the break from the soviet union was not clean. a major event in modern azeri history is [black january when soviet forces killed over 130 azeri civilians protesting for independence under the guise of preventing attacks on the armenian minority population; this incident was not well publicized in the west (best explanation is due to geographic remoteness from journalists), however world attention/condemnation appeared several months later when the soviets began the same policy of violence against lithuania (which was across the baltic from the west). during and after this period was the bloody nagorno-karabakh war (see below). ##what about the shape? azerbaijan has an odd shape with a large exclave, nakhchivan, on the other side of armenia (the relationship with armenia deserves its own section, below). the shape actually makes sense if you look at the geographic distribution of the azeri people: thanks to and [1828 between the russian and persian empires, 2/3 of azeris *live in what is now iran* where there are two provinces, named [east and [west and a major azeri city of tabriz near the large disappearing [lake when you take into account the iranian side of the azeri population, the exclave is just a finger of that larger combined area reaching to turkey. iran, which is only ~55% persian, is always worried about rising nationalism its azeri provinces that border azerbaijan. in practice, running into iranian-azeris in the us will have them describe themselves as persian/iranian rather than azeri so over 200 years of being split up there is some catching up to do. ##the elephant in the room: armenia &amp; nagorno-karabakh the passions are so hot on this subject that i am only going to touch on it “briefly”: the contested area of nagorno-karabakh is one of the least-publicized hot zones in the world. after a war from 1988-1994, the existing ceasefire has flare-ups similar to the kashmiri border. even before that much violence and bloodshed had been spilled upon the peoples in this geographic region spilling into both countries (with a major flair up in the years after the collapse of the russian empire). the borders between the two countries were always terribly drawn due to the intermixing of the two peoples and what has been called “stalin's creative mapmaking skills”. in the final years of the soviet union, the two countries began fighting over the disputed areas which intensified after the fall of the soviet union in 1991. the war was filled with atrocities, ethnic cleansing, over a million displaced people, and horrors for all involved. by 1994 when a ceasefire was signed, 20% of azerbaijan was occupied by armenia, and that is the status quo today. the occupied area holds itself out as an independent state but it is not recognized by any country—including armenia—due to its extremely controversial position (the three entities that recognize it are unrecognized breakaway republics of abkhazia (georgia), south ossetia (georgia) and transnistria (moldova)). outside of this conflict both peoples are regular folks, but the practical situation for a traveler is there are no connections between the two countries and visiting one can cause issues with visiting the other and visiting the occupied area will permanently ban you from visiting (to say nothing about ethnic members of either side who are totally unwelcome). don't bring this topic up in either country, it's an open wound and simply not worth it (their edit wars on wikipedia were the stuff of legend several years ago before all the articles were locked down). ##baku the name baku (bah-koo) appears to derive from the persian word for wind (bahd)—and there is a lot of it, the weather can change rapidly. the region (within an hour drive) has history going back to the stone age. by the 11th century, the city was a significant trading post on the caspian sea. in the 12th century, it became the capital of the shirvanshahs before they were defeated by the safavid dynasty and later the ottomans. as noted above, the oil boom in the 19th century radically changed the city, which began to expand into a paris on the caspian (yes, many cities call themselves the “paris of the ___”, but the construction at the time does warrant some comparison). soviet rule put the city into a bit of stasis and turned the areas around baku into an industrial wasteland (the soviets were the opposite of green), but for the most part the old parts of the city were spared any serious/horrific urban renewal (indeed the early soviet buildings were quite tasteful)—this reminded me of [tallinn's well-preserved old post-independence brought a series of building booms, and the most recent one (especially after 2007) has resulted in some dramatic and modern changes that bring the city a cosmopolitan flair in its central core by the shore of the caspian sea. due to the decrease in oil prices the currency (manat) had fallen, so during my visit the exchange was almost exactly 1 usd to 1 azd. okay, enough unending prose, let's dive into the photos! i've reorganized my previous posts into sections on specific areas and cultural aspects. i've also added links to websites and google maps. *** ###(2) baku's old city (sec2) *** the old city of baku retains it walls and is a classic medieval maze of streets that make it easy to get lost (which in this case is part of the fun). while the oldest buildings date from the 11th century, many buildings date from afterward but still have charm: even those built by the soviets. there was an alarming building boom in the 21st century, but all that redevelopment has been halted and instead buildings are being renovated on the inside: unesco issued a warning in 2003 and by 2009 had praised the efforts to turn around the area, and it does appear to have all been done in good faith. there are three primary unesco sites (maiden tower, shirvanshah palace, mohammad mosque) but the area is full of many other notable sites (caravanserais, hammans, mosques, etc). ##maiden tower ([google &gt;this is “the” symbol of baku: the enigmatic tower, its origin and purpose lost to history, is 100 feet tall and sits prominently at the edge of the old city. theories as to its creation. the term “maiden” comes from one of the many mythical stories attributed to it: that a fair maiden, rejecting the advances of a nobleman, threw herself from the top. what we do know is that it was built by the 12th century, has very thick walls, has a well, has gutters on floors 2-7, has a doorway to nowhere on an upper floor, has some orientation to the stars, and was at one point at the shore of the caspian as it rose an lowered over the centuries. guidebooks used to bemoan the confusing displays inside (which were a random, poorly labeled smattering of historical bits and pieces) but after a major restoration, completed in 2013 in conjunction with an austrian company, the interior is actually quite educational with a variety of interactive displays covering a theme on each of its eight floors. the view from the top is excellent. tourist shot in front of the maiden's tower (there aren't many with me, i promise): &gt; view from the top, the glass barriers were nicely done: &gt; another shot of the maiden tower from the bulvar (more on that below) that shows a classic oil boom building: the hajinski mansion (""ugly"" side shown). the mansion is private but has a small tom ford boutique on the bottom corner (there are a *lot* of high end boutiques in the bulvar and fountain square area of baku). the caspian used to come up to the maiden tower, but authorities built up the shore (which also protects it from occasional rises, the caspian is below sea level) so now it's about 300 yards away with the bulvar park in between. baku is currently 92 feet below sea level on the coast! &gt; ##shirvanshah palace ([google &gt;shirvanshah (sher-vahn-shah) means kings of shirvan, who moved to baku after their original capital was devastated by an earthquake. they built their palace in the 15th century on the tallest point of the old city, and it has been mostly preserved over the ensuing centuries and includes the main palace, royal mosque, mausoleum, garden, and ruins of the hammam. the complex underwent a substantial restoration and includes displays and decorative stones from an old [bayil fortress discovered just off the coast of baku ([google rediscovered in the 1960s when the caspian sea had lowered enough for archaeologists to explore it). a view of the caspian a window in the shirvanshah palace. the building had been damaged by russaan bombardment in the 19th century, but has been restored including these window covers which both offer protection from the sun and offer privacy. &gt; carving over a palace door. azeris don't use the arabic alphabet anymore; in the 1920s the briefly independent azerbaijan instituted the latin alphabet (similar to the progressive work of ataturk in turkey), and the soviets eventually swapped that with cyrillic. after independence they went back to turkey's established latin alphabet (lots of accent marks). &gt; very stylish of ottoman era—mustache protectors for sleep. &gt; *** [character limit reached: continued in comments

* **one party refuses to raise taxes to pay down our 17 trillion in debt and blocks every attempt to do so** (this *is* the key difference of the class war that has been/is being waged and illustrates the clearest difference between the democrats and republican parties: where one party supports business and the other prioritizes business wealth *at the expense* of middle class priorities. it's also the biggest driver of our deficit since bush/cheney cut them with no offsets. it was criminally negligent to *choose* to run our country into debt via 500 billion dollar in annual deficits and immoral to do so while we were fighting two wars. this is that shameful gop [starve the policy that *every american* should vote against the gop for waging. it is front and center in the class war against the average american and **the gop own it.** ) * one party supports unions, raising the minimum wage, and wage equality for women the other doesn't * one party supports the right for women to family plan and the other doesn't * one party wants immigration reform and the other doesn't * one party attempted to keep america from the joining the ranks of *every other 1st world nation* in having universal healthcare coverage for it's citizens, the other one enacted and defended that. generally speaking, democrats own the safety net. they have defended it and strengthened it for 100 years. that having a safety net in america makes you hated by conservatives when it is literally the source of happiness and quality of life for people all over the free world is a mystery to me. each of these gop positions hurts citizens but helps corporations. my reasoning is that putting dems in right now (how things were in 08) gets us back to sanity. it also sends the message that obstruction should be a losing not a winning strategy to the gop. their obstruction has [cost this country 1 to 3 million in our tepid recovery and it needs to be punished. am i blindly partisan?

ba87add3-ef78-4691-9231-261ad0be5fa6,"hi reddit, my name is rebekah l. rogers and i am an assistant professor in the department of bioinformatics at unc charlotte. my research focuses on genome structure changes and new gene formation. i recently published a study titled [“excess of genomic defects in a woolly mammoth on wrangel with montgomery slatkin. we reanalyzed genome sequences for two woolly mammoths. one specimen came from siberia at a time when mammoths were happy and healthy. the other comes from a small population that existed on wrangel island until 3700 years ago, another 600 years after all mainland mammoths had gone extinct. we found that bad mutations were accumulating in woolly mammoth genomes just before they went extinct. the accumulation of bad mutations is consistent with mathematical theories predicting that natural selection becomes inefficient in small populations. under these circumstances, bad mutations could accumulate in genomes that normally would be weeded out by competition. the mammoth from wrangel island had 50% more of its genes broken compared with the mainland mammoth from much earlier. several different types of bad mutations had accumulated— large deletions in the dna, retrogenes (which reflect the action of selfish virus-like dna sequences), and single letters that would cause genes to terminate early. many of the broken genes are urinary proteins and the olfactory receptors that detect them — genes important for social signaling. we also discovered that the mammoth from the island had mutations that would give him a shiny satin coat. these results may be important for conservation. they suggest that other very small populations of endangered species might undergo the same type of mutational meltdown. in our mammoths, we found that it required many generations to see a signal as strong as what we observed in the wrangel island genome. **the sooner we can intervene to bring endangered species back to normal levels, the better off their genomes will be.** there are many factors that influence extinction. climate change, habitat destruction, and hunting were all very important for the mammoths’ demise. still, these bad mutations certainly did not help them as the struggled to adapt on the island. listen to the 60 second science on our work. i will be answering your questions at 1pm et. ask me anything! don’t forget to follow me on twitter or elsewhere on reddit as rlrogers. alright! 1pm et! ready to go! ok, thanks for all the fun questions!! i had a great time! now it's back to the lab to collect fruit flies!",none,5

*edit: please note that this wasn't intended to be an ama, but we are planning to schedule one with the mods in the coming weeks!* * the irs is responsible for raising 90 percent of the revenue coming into the federal government. the total revenue raised in 2013 was $2.9 trillion. thus the irs raised $2.6 trillion in 2013. * the irs budget in 2013 was $11.8 billion. in 2010 the irs budget was $12.3 billion; in 2015 the irs budget is expected to be $10.2 billion. there has been a 17% reduction in funding of the irs between 2010 and 2014 or stated differently a 25% reduction in real dollars. * the non-partisan irs oversight board recommended a $12.5 billion budget for 2015 which the irs needs to be fully funded. the house of representatives is currently recommending $10.2 billion budget for 2015, which is an 18% reduction in funding. * the irs raised $2.6 trillion in 2013 on a budget of $11.8 billion, the total cost per dollar raised by the irs is less than one-half cent per dollar ($.0045/$1). * **the irs through enforcement of the tax laws brings in $4 to $7 in additional revenue to the federal government for every $1 expended. an 18% reduction in funding represents a loss in revenue to the federal government of $9.2 billion to $16.1 billion.** * through enforcement actions the irs brings in approximately 2.5% of the $2.6 trillion that it raises. that means that approximately 97.5% of the money raised by the irs is collected through taxpayers that voluntarily comply with the tax laws. * there has been a 15% increase in delinquent accounts between 2010 and 2014. in 2010 there were 10,391,000 delinquent accounts. in 2013 there were 11,721,000 delinquent accounts, with an estimated 12,000,000 in 2014. * there has been a 21% decrease in exam returns audited between 2010 and 2014. in 2010 there were 1,835,883 exam returns audited. in 2013 there were 1,558,057 exam returns audited, with an estimated 1,460,000 exam returns audited in 2014. * the field audit rate for audits is now at 0.25% and the percentage is continuing to decline due to the continuing decline in the number of employees available to do audits. * there has been 15% reduction in the irs workforce since 2010. in 2010 the irs employed 94,346. in 2013 the workforce had been reduced to 83,613, and in 2014 the workforce has been reduced to approximately 80,000. * the irs historically helped 500,000 poor, disabled and elderly with their returns. now the irs doesn’t help any of them with direct return preparation according to nina olson, irs taxpayer advocate. * **in 2009 59,000 americans were victims of identity theft. in 2013 that number was 3,000,000 with $5.2 billion stolen from the u.s. government. in 2016 it is estimated identity theft will grow to $21 billion.** * the year 2006 was the last year research analysis was conducted on compliance by american taxpayers. in that year compliance was 83% which means there was a 17% tax gap overall. research has not been funded subsequently to determine the current tax gap, so we don’t know how bad it is today. * **if voluntary compliance with the tax code drops by 1 %, the cost to the u.s. government is $30 billion per year.** * practitioners working on returns can count on a typical wait of 45 minutes and not necessarily speak with the right person to help them with their concerns or a person properly trained to assist them. * the irs closed two major criminal cases resulting in $2 billion and $7 billion. now congress wants to cut the staff in cid in half by 2016 from approximately 3,500 to 1,600. congress needs to know where you stand on this issue, so vote, write and spread the word!

0cf26862-0766-4068-84ae-13aa55dc2134,"i need to vent. i have no one to talk to about my family issues cause i never shared and i'm so lonely right now. i'm bawling despicably and i'm so close to shattering completely. i hope you guys listen to me. warning - it's long. it's super long. but, please bear with me and to those who read till the end. thank you, it means a fuck ton to me. i am 26f. i live independently in a different country. quite accomplished academically speaking. work in a great company and i earn well. i am, by all means, a very happy and satisfied person. please don't think i'm tooting my own horn. what i mentioned is very relevant to what i am gonna say next. my parents are also super educated, relatively wealthy and live in a metropolitan city in india. they raised me to be independent, strong and to challenge and question the world. at least, those were the words they used. i took in their words. found reason in them. firmly believed in the idea of challenging and critically thinking of everything. be it in academic/professional/personal life, i challenged it. my opinions were formed after years of observation and self-debate. i identify as a liberal-progressive female. i have always credited my parents for who i am today. but, today it all just shattered and broke into a million pieces. everything i believed about my parents was a lie and i'm just...broken. like most indian girls, my family has been behind me for a long time on getting married and tried to explain to me that this is what needs to be done beyond a certain age. this is how it should be. it's what society expects and going against the grain of the society is sure not advisable. it's not good for me and it's definitely not good for them because what will people think of us ?! i've fought off most of the advances from my parents, my relatives, my neighbors. told them that marriage is an important event. it should not be done cause society thinks so. hence, i stand by my opinion that i will only get married if i want to, when i want to and to whomever i want to. it's non-negotiable. since, at the end of the day, i will be living with that person for a long period of time (barring divorce). it might be crude to say, but i will outlive my parents. my wishes in this regard outweigh theirs. i've quoted their positions regarding independent thinking back at them. told them that they are the ones who taught me not to be a sheep. to do things that i believe in. it's always been a bit of a struggle but it worked out. they were like mini fights.. subliminal and perennially ebbing but never a showdown. my trips to india was mostly pleasant. i got to spend time with my family, enjoy good food, meet my relatives and deal with this occasional drama. yesterday, my mum attended a wedding of her friend's son. she called me immediately after and said how all of them were pestering her about my wedding and how she can't stall any longer and i ought to get married. i reiterated all my previous statements. i completely understand that attending that wedding resulted in a rise of those feelings of inadequacy again. like always she said i'm just being a coward and that once i get married it'll all get better. according to her, i don't know what i want in life. i'm not happy or satisfied. my house is empty. who'll take care of me when they are dead ? who'll take care of my brother when they are dead ? people will say something is wrong with me and that i have a loose character (whatever the dafaq that means) and they won't be wrong. all her friend's children (she'll start naming every single one of them) are also educated, they listen to their parents and make them proud, got married and some even have kids now. i need to get off my high horse and that i'm not the only one who's educated. i don't know why but this time around, she brought up the concept of education multiple times. as if she was implying that it's the reason behind my current status. to be honest, at this point, it was really getting to me. i've explained countless times to my parents that i'm happy. shouldn't they be happy that they have a daughter who's happy with her life ? she's having a ball, she talks to them happily when on call. she is excited to come back home and visit them. what's wrong with that ?! why is that not enough ? why is what the society thinks more important to them ? i'm the one who'll mourn if something ever happened to them. i'm the one that'll drop everything and rush to them. i'm the one that loves them. not the society. do i not matter more ? anyway, to all the questions my mum posed. my answers were the following - \&gt; you don't know what you want in life - wrong, you think i got to where i'm in life right now by just winging it ? i know what i want from my life for the moment. truth is, beyond a certain age, parents' don't know much about their children. it's just a way of life. my parents don't know a lot about the adult me and that's okay. you've raised me well. have faith in it. let me make my own decisions. \&gt; you are not happy or satisfied - umm, what ?! nope, i'm pretty fucking happy. i love my life. she does know i have a boyfriend btw. i'm quite satisfied with my life and where it is atm. \&gt; my house is empty - it's as full as it needs to be. \&gt; who'll take care of me when they are dead ? - i can take care of myself. what do you think i've been doing all these years ?. i don't need a guy to take care of me. i'm not a fucking burden. i've been out of your home since i was 17. did my entire education purely on scholarships and funding. how am i burden ? \&gt; who'll take care of my brother when they are dead ? - i will !! what else ? i've already told you that i will fund my brother's m.d. what did you think, my husband will take care of my brother ? why on earth will he do that ? i love my brother. i'll be there for him and he'll be there for me. \&gt; people will say something is wrong with me and that i have a loose character - fuck them. i know loads of ""people"" who are married and are terrible people. i may not be married but i've fought on the streets for what i believe in. i'm happy with who i am as a person. i know i matter to those who i fought for and i know they'll do the same for me. my society is different from yours and it's built on love and respect. and, not the fake kind. this entire conversation ended with her telling me it was a mistake to educate me. according to her, i'm not an indian any more. i'm a fucking european. i'm a blind follower with no thought of my own despite the fact, these opinions have been expressed to her since i was a teenager. my parents just never truly heard me. she felt that had i been not this ""highly"" educated, i would have been the perfect daughter who listed to her parents and valued indian ideals. now, i'm just a foreigner who'll bring shame upon the family. i'm selfish and don't care for anyone beyond myself. this sentence broke me. i've worked so hard to be where i got here. academic life is no joke. active research is no joke. i spent years of my life toiling and enjoying my line of work. all that reduced to ""we should not have educated you at all cause ... fucking marriage"". is that all i am ? just a burden to be written away ? i know if i did succumb to their wishes, next thing on the platter would be kids. what i want should matter !!! i'm so tired at this point of everyone telling me how i'm a social failure, how i hurt my parents with my independent thoughts, how i bring untold shame and disgrace to my family. it's my parents, my relatives, their neighbors and every fucking uncle and aunty harrassing me over it. i finally broke down and told my parents in a long letter that if they expect me to give up my life for their expectations and wishes, they are the ones who are selfish. it's not my character that is loose for doing what i want to do, but rather theirs that needs reflection for even thinking so. told them firmly that i will only do what i want to do because when i'm on my death bed. i don't want to regret anything. every decision i took and it's consequence is mine to bear. whether good or bad, i'll handle it. my mum blamed her father, her marriage, her brother and her children for the her life turned out to be. i know she has a lingering feeling of what if. i will not become her. my dad took so much offense to my letter. he told me should have been a terrorist dad like his friends. none of their kids will say the things that i said to them. all his friend's kids are so afraid of their parents. they blindly do what their parents ask them to. told him that that's a sad relationship. i've been quite honest and liberal with my parents because i respect them as individuals. his friend's kids don't. i know because i'm friends with them. they live a whole double life and constantly feed lies to their parents. even if my opinions are hard for you to understand, i've been nothing but honest and presented the whole truth. isn't that something he values ? the openness and the truth has to matter, right ? and finally, he said a daughter should do what her parents' ask her to do. if not, she's a third party. this shocked me to my bones. i reiterated what he said and asked if that's what he means. his answer was yes. i chose my independence and my autonomy. i'm now, a third party and my heart is broken and inconsolable. i don't think they'll ever understand. i'm a failure to them. thanks for reading. edit: there are so many wonderful replies and direct messages. i can't stress enough how much reading it means to me. just like you guys, i hope they'll come around. my brother is still there for me. i'm thankful for his existence. in a way, you are my home away from home. thanks r/india.",none,5

b9085a49-9fa3-4607-9bb9-ad57533dfe1b,"*tl;dr - physically abused as a kid. psychologically abused as a teen and young adult. in my 30s and raging at myself and videogames because i never had anyone sit me down and explain what ptsd is and how it can strangle me.* hello. when i was younger. i was physically abused by my father and by bullies. there've been a lot of ""that was fucked up"" things that have happend here and there in my teens and 20s. plus a long-term toxic living-situation with a relative that i only recently (a month or so) got out of. the toxic-masculinity i was raised with says those things that happend besides the physical abuse ""don't count."" regardless, none of which was ever dealt with properly. i love videogames. enough to make a career out of them. but i've always had a lot of trouble making friendships so most of my gaming was single player. i also grew up in the 80s so most of my formative gaming was done well before the idea of ""online multiplayer"" became a core component of game design. pvp (player vs player / ""competitive"" games) causes excessive anxiety for me. every time i would get shot or killed it'd make a little ""ping"" in my brain of irritation. after a few rounds (especially losing rounds.) i'd feel very depressed. i'd want to quit the game (and infact, i didn't even want to play any games. even my go-to single player games.) recently this happend. i felt angry/shitty for the entire next day. even if i could see the logic in how insigifigant a random loss in a random game was i still felt angry. it makes me anxious to even enter a pvp game since there's essentially a 50/50 chance that i'll be saddled with an angry malaise for the next day if the match goes sour. additionally there is a vr game called echo arena. it's a sports game (zero gravity frisbee-rugby is the best way i can explain it). it involves being able to strike another player's head to stun them for a moment. each time i'd get struck it would send a sudden, angry jolt through me. it's enough that when my husband plays i sometimes have to put in my earbuds and listen to music so i don't hear all of it's sound effects/music/etc. a few days ago i was trying out a new vr robot fighting game's training mode. i enjoyed it. i enjoyed it very much. then i went to fight an opponent and saw that the game was online-only. i simply took the headset off, handed it to my husband and walked away. i felt shitty. i attacked myself for being a quitter. for not simply forcing myself to expose myself to it in the hopes that the anxiety would be lessend. i've always been. . . cruel with myself. there's a very very very angry person inside of me that takes a supreme pleasure in beating me down. so i went back into the living room and sat on the couch while my husband was playing the game, watched his match. afterwards we talked held hands for a bit. i managed to work up the courage to tell him how it felt both walking away from the game and the aftermath. then it just kind of avalanched into me having a breakdown and him suggesting that my reaction was pretty clearly ptsd. when he said that i just kept sobbing for what felt like another 20 minutes. i think i sort of understood that it was ptsd. i volunteer at a local vfw (veterans of foreign wars) and happend to read a coupld pamphlets on ptsd. the stories in them made me cry. though at the time i couldn't allow myself to say ""yes, this is a ptsd type reaction you have."" toxic masculinity. thank you for reading this. i know stories like this are probably dime-a-dozen but it makes me feel good that at least someone else knows. i'm not sure where to go from here. i'm pretty broke and almost all of my money for now is going towards bills and food. i have my state's basic free insurance ohp (oregon health plan) but i'm not sure what kind of psychological services they could provide. i'm hesitant to start a regimen of anxiety medications if it's possible to work through things. open to any advice. thank you very much in advance.",ptsd,4

824ae3a0-1789-490d-bf27-e32f812fd741,"tomorrow i am going to a 5 day retreat for adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse. i wrote a post about going 3 months ago in june, that i went at that time. but i had to leave after 1 day, i have an issue with blockages in my ears, but in the past it was something that always happened in 1 ear. in june, 4 days before i went it happened in both ears, i was pretty much deafened, it made it so i could only hear at all if the person was yelling or speaking loudly from 2 feet away. i went to the retreat anyway in june, it had been something i had been looking towards for months and though i had found it my social worker and therapist had been needed to be accepted, not going seemed foolish as it may easily have looked liked avoidance or an excuse, so i went anyway despite not being able to hear. i stayed for dinner and one of the 3 therapists took me into town to the hospital to get my ear flushed, had tried the ear washing kit from the pharmacy, but am afraid of hospitals. we waited 8 ours at the hospital, it was the middle of the night when we returned, but the doctor tried a number of times, the blockages were quite severe. i slept, we hoped at least one ear would open overnight, but it did not, so i could not participate and had to leave. it was thankfully after i had been in therapy 7 months, to be honest it took a great deal of willpower not to react in a way, anger or extreme depression or suicidality if i am honest, that would have likely prevented me from returning. it was honestly incredibly disappointing, i was new to therapy, it honestly felt like the universe itself did not want healing for the trauma, that in the end i had deserved it. it made it harder that i had never experienced anything like the near full deafness before, it was 5 days into that, really incredibly frustrating. but i just kept reminding myself it was a blockage, that i was not permanently deaf, that the people there were being sincere that i could return in september. that was a big thing in truth. at heart i was convinced i would never be able to return, that the universe wouldn't allow it, that the therapists in charge did not like me and wouldn't have it, that they were lying to me to be kind. but i did everything i could think of well i was still there, through breakfast and lunch until my ride could get me from where i live 5 hours away. i phoned my actual therapist, but mostly i sat alone and chained smoked, if someone talked to me i tried to be nice and polite, and i simply reminded myself that all the evidence showed this would be possible in september, that only by acting out could i fuck it up. so i left well, pretending hopefulness i did not feel, with everyone's well wishes. now i return tomorrow. disability is paying for my ride, i am taking the train for the first time. it was really a wonderful place. there were the 3 therapists, it is a small program with 12 men or woman in a group, one group at a time 10 times a year, at a fancy cottage on a lake in the woods. it had, though i did not see it as i was not there so long, a beach area and woods with paths and an obstacle course. it practices a relational type of therapy that is similar to my own therapist. it was really an enormous opportunity, i am grateful i can return, it is the only thing like it in the province or indeed the country. there are other types of retreats for csa, but they are very expensive and not covered by anyone. this is run privately, but is the only one like it that is covered by the provincial health care, with a referral from a therapist or social worker and a pretty short wait list. anyway, i am hopeful. it was very hard to see it at the time, but it may be better i am going now rather than june. despite the fact i accepted it intellectually i had not got past the self blame thing regarding the abuse as a kid, not at any real emotional level, that was something i only really got to 1 month ago, therapy itself has helped me enormously. i am trying to be reasonable with my hopes. but having got past the self blame, i hope for some real processing.therapy itself has helped so much. i have gotten a first part time job, and another one i start in 9 days after this when the first job ended due to seasonal reasons. i am 1 credit from finishing highschool, i am taking the bookwork with me in the hopes of doing it during down times. i have officially lost the gad diagnosis, now it is just the autism, ptsd and depression, and as things are going it looks like the depression diagnosis will be gone in a few months. i have reduced the drinking so it no longer badly harms me or affects my loved ones, and i have gone on 2 dates for the first time in 37 years. things have improved enormously. but 10 months now of therapy has helped me to process 1 of the ""big t' trauma"" things out of what appears to be 16 or 18 things, i am hopeful this will help some of that stuff. anyway, i hope everyone on this sub is wonderful, that things go incredibly well, and thank anyone who reads this.",ptsd,4

1c2d3847-aa09-480e-8a17-482261568af2,"so i was diagnosed with ptsd today. having a lot of weird feelings. i just need to share some self insights, maybe you had a similar reaction at first. victims of abuse tend to spend a lot of time in denial. i've come a lot of similar posts on this thread. 'i feel like i didn't have it that bad'. if you grew up in an invalidating environment and are possibly still in touch with those people, you probably spend a lot of time feeling guilty for having negative emotions. my therapist apparently had a pre-emptive diagnosis but wanted to confirm a couple things so she had me fill out a questionnaire about dissociative symptoms and i scored extremely highly. it turns out that missing entire chunks of conversations or regularly walking for 20 minutes without remembering any part of the walk is not 'normal'. she told me she'd decided to diagnose me with ptsd, and this was a strong confirmation. she asked what i thought, i wanted to scoff. i told her i completely disagreed. that i hadn't been through 'traumatic' events, only things that were at best deeply upsetting. i'd never been sexually abused, i hadn't been in a war-zone. i associate ptsd with extremely horrible life events, like 9/11. then she said 'well the thing about 9/11 is that some people who were actually there when it happened, walked away and never carried any trauma with them, and recovered perfectly fine. others, who only saw it on the news, were deeply traumatised. trauma isn't about the event itself, it's about the individuals subjective reaction to it. and the fact that you describe these events from childhood as 'deeply upsetting' indicates that they were traumatic' i still wasn't entirely convinced, so she asked me if i thought what i had gone through was normal or whether most people go through that. i said 'i think most people's parents can be pretty horrible in one way or another'. her answer was 'no, they're not actually'. and then it hit me like a massive bomb when i got home. these days, it's really hard to tell what is actually 'offensive' and what isn't. people throw around words like 'trigger' and there's all this discourse about how we're all too sensitive, and as we're growing up even, we're told to eat our food because 'kids in africa are starving'. even walking to therapy, i feel a certain level of guilt, i wondered if i'm 'entitled' or 'self-absorbed', i told myself that other people have it worse and they never go to therapy, and maybe i just need to suck it up. even before i went to therapy, my mum said 'why, nothing is wrong with your life?’ i had this important realisation that even though my life is not the worst, it doesn’t mean i have to pretend it was acceptable or ‘fine’. honestly, if i had been beaten or sexually abused, i’d probably be saying the same thing: ‘it could have been worse’. i walk around my whole life telling myself those words anytime something bad happens to me. it’s good to acknowledge that you are lucky in many ways, and to be grateful for the positive elements of your life. other people out there certainly have it worse, that’s a fact. but that’s no reason to reduce your own experience. and don't let others do it either. for some, it would have been perfectly fine, i know people who have gone through the same experience as mine and came out relatively unscathed. but for me, it was a really horrible thing to go through. the question isn’t, ‘did you have it worse than everybody else out there?’ or 'could you have just coped with it better?. it is ‘how did it make you feel?’. me - it made me angry, furious. it made me sad, it made me feel helpless, it made me constantly wish for change. and as a child, i wasn’t able to create that change. i was stuck in a shitty situation that only got shittier over time, and it sucked dick. if it hurt you, deeply, and you carry those wounds with you today, don't let anybody tell you that you're not allowed to have those feelings. if you feel it, you feel it. i'm not calling anybody here a victim but we don't choose how we process every single event in our lives. anyway this might be obvious to everybody but me, maybe i've just had terrible self insight but if you can relate to this mindset, stop trying to 'pull yourself up by the bootstraps'. just remember that you didn't want whatever it was that happened to you in the past and it's okay to ask for help today.",ptsd,4

05112829-af04-412c-ab00-728122acbca6,"i wasn’t sure where to post this so i apologise in advance if this isn’t the right place, but was hoping to get some advice from people a better understanding of this. my girlfriend in the past has received a diagnosis for cptsd after she experienced a sustained trauma as a child. she told me this early on in our relationship but it has never been mentioned since. but i feel that it is still affecting her everyday life in a very significant way. she doesn’t sleep from nightmares, she’s hyper vigilant at all times, often descends into the deepest sadness for days at a time, says the most awful things about herself, she gets faint, sometimes disassociated or shuts down completely, and is so incredibly anxious most of the time. she just isn’t happy or enjoying her life at all. i have in the past gently suggested that she talk to a therapist, not with direct reference to c-ptsd but because she has told me she wants to die, or because of self harm, and this is met with quite a lot of hostility, saying that i thought she was crazy or just shifting my responsibility as a boyfriend on to a therapist, and it has almost lead to break-ups, so i haven’t suggested it in a while. another part of it is that within our relationship when i have made mistakes, nothing that i felt was too major - getting a bit cross, or being late to a meet up, it’s been world shattering for her, sent her spiralling down for days. she told me that sometimes she almost cries when she sees me because of the relief and safety it makes her feel. i was so touched that she felt that way but it also made me realise the responsibility i have, how careful i need to be to not make any slip-ups, and why she finds it so hard to forgive little things - if they’ve made her feel this awful i don’t really blame her. and it also made me realise that i actually never talk about how i’m feeling or if i’m upset, because of fear of upsetting her. there have been times when i’ve felt more like a carer than a boyfriend, i feel awful for saying that but it is how it’s felt. it is beginning to really affect me too and i don’t feel that that is sustainable in a relationship. i think that i need to encourage her to seek help, but to be more upfront and talk about the c-ptsd and how i see her feeling, and to say that i don’t think things can continue with the way they currently are, with her whole world being dependent on me. because i’ll inevitably slip up from time to time with little things as people do, and i don’t want her to have to feel so so sad when i do. but i do want to be with her, i love her and i want most for her to be happy. but i know that me suggesting this will not go down well. she doesn’t see the symptoms i mentioned as anything more than just situational - she doesn’t like work or she’s just tired. but while the situations have always changed the feelings haven’t. what i was hoping was if anyone with more experience of the condition might be able to make clearer is whether i am doing the right thing by suggesting getting help, and if so whether there are specific things i should avoid saying that could make the cptsd worse, or if there’s a best way to go about it. i don’t want to bring up her old trauma with her anymore than i need to, i really don’t want to upset her with this, but i just don’t feel things are sustainable as they currently are. thank you for any advice",ptsd,4

71f8af8b-ebca-49a0-975f-19b5194e149c,"hi, reddit. i need to vent for a minute. i have a very, very hard time talking about my trauma to others, but i'm in a point in life right now where i'm trying really hard to better myself and my life, and i feel like typing out some of what i went through and sharing it on here may help me a little. last week, i moved halfway across the country to get away from the area where my trauma occurred, after being stuck there for years. i know moving won't fix everything, but it gave me a lot of positive momentum and there are much much fewer triggers out here, seeing as the whole area is very new to me. and i feel as though being in a place that allows me to relax a bit and triggers me less will help me to heal over time by giving me a more comfortable environment. my trauma was an abusive relationship. my ex girlfriend (i am also a girl, btw) was extremely manipulative and emotionally abusive. by the end of the relationship, she had instilled a fear so deep inside me that i lost my mind for a bit and stopped sleeping, eating, and functioning. i was so detached from reality in that breaking point that i couldn't focus on the world around me very well, and i ended up in the er 3 different times in 2 weeks from severe injuries caused by accidents i got into due to the lack of attention and awareness i felt in this terrified mental state. my ex never hit me, but she had physically harmed many others and would tell me the details of it, thoroughly, despite knowing how much it frightened me. she was aggressive, dangerous, and i witnessed a lot of the shit she put others through, in addition to my accidents she had an indirect influence in. she also made me feel useless, worthless, and like i didn't deserve love from anyone. when we broke up, she called me crazy and all my friends at the time who had seen me in that breaking point moment abandoned me because they thought i had lost my mind. i was only 19 back then, and didn't know how to cope with or process any of it. for a while i used alcohol and drugs to cope, and i was so miserable that i spent my days wanting my life to end. after about a year and a half of negative coping, i made a lot of changes in my life and started practicing mindfulness meditation, working out, stopped drinking, developed some hobbies, and started to rebuild a social life again. things went well until i started developing the symptoms of ptsd over time. it came on gradually, and then suddenly last fall i found myself feeling very stuck and overwhelmed with it all at once. i sought help and got diagnosed last october. it's been a very defeating feeling to be battling with this and feeling like i'm going right back to my trauma constantly. i've dealt with flashbacks, nightmares, insomnia, aggression/rage, startle response, hypervigilance, sadness/emptiness, and avoiding everything that reminded me of the past. so, this may, i graduated from college finally and my lease was up on my house in june, so i decided to just leave the area entirely, as i mentioned before. i know running away won't solve all my problems, as i've already said, but i also feel so much better up here already compared to where i was before. i know i have a lot of work and healing to do, but i can't shake the feeling that that decision to leave was the best one i've ever made in my life. for the first time in years i'm starting to feel a little better, and i think getting out of there is going to help me to get to a positive mindset in the long run. overall i've made some progress in healing, but i know i still have a lot to go. like i said, i'm not good at talking about this and i'm not used to putting it into words, so i'm sorry for how long this post was and if it was difficult to follow. i just wanted to share my story in a safe space, and this sub seemed like a good place to start. i'm hoping this move continues to bring me positive vibes, and one day i can completely move on with my life from what happened to me as a teenager.",ptsd,4

43d830aa-66d5-4f38-bf73-9909c06b1fcb,"hi everyone, this is a bit of a rant, but i was wondering if any of you have had similar experiences and how you handled it. i have had some pretty terrible experiences in my childhood related to various forms of abuse. i don't talk about it much and only my husband and a few close friends know what i've gone through. i generally feel like i've been handling it well despite living with some form of depression and anxiety throughout my life. that's not what this is about though. i've had a friend since highschool \(over a decade\) and have always found them combative but kind of dealt with it. this weekend i was at a bbq where this particular individual was. someone made a comment about women's rights and how it's not important. i \(of course\) said it was important to me. i told everyone you never know what people have experienced due to their gender, sexual orientation, race, trauma they've experience, etc. so it's important to be sensitive. everyone was like, ok that makes sense. except for this one guy. he started going off about how he doesn't believe in being sensitive, he doesn't care about triggering other people. i tried to explain that talking like that could really hurt someone \(i was for sure hurt\). he kept going and kept saying that people are stupid and he doesn't care. he said people have become too sensitive and should just keep their crap to themselves. i challenged him and asked if he would care if someone close to him had been abused or dealt with some form of ptsd. he said no, those people are wimps and shouldn't be bothering him with it. long story short i got pissed, stood up and basically yelled at him spilling the beans about what i had gone through. i said that this conversation triggered me and ran out of the house. i'm feeling really upset about this for a bunch of reasons. firstly, i thought i had dealt with my past but obviously there are still unresolved issues. secondly, i'm pissed that this supposed friend would be so terrible, thirdly, i'm pissed i spilled the beans about my trauma to so many people. have any of you had to cut people out of your lives that you thought were your friends because they just didn't understand or didn't try to? i still haven't received any apology or any attempt to smooth things over, so i really truly don't think this person cares. and that sucks.",ptsd,4

701f4c7d-c2c5-4a34-94b5-346bae01ca1c,"first post here, so bear with me, please. i am a 32 male who was diagnosed with c-ptsd just last year, with the roots of the disorder beginning around 26 years ago. i will not go into the full detail of why it exists until a later date because this is more about me inadvertently trying to sabotage the best thing that has ever happened to me and how to fix it. i met the love of my life a little over seven months ago. she is, literally, my soulmate. i know people may call bs on this, and i wouldn't blame anyone who has or does because seven months ago i would have thought the same thing, but it is ridiculous: we love the same music, have the exact same sense of humor, have the same hobbies, we point (yes, something as piddly as this) in the same ridiculous way with two fingers, we say the same thing at the same time multiple times/day, and to top it all off we are the exact same height (though she still claims to have a 1/8"" advantage over me). she is by far the most amazing, beautiful woman i have ever met. i had literally sworn off marriage/children until i met her and knew immediately i wanted them with her. she, herself, is coming out of a bad divorce and has had a horrible year since, losing her house, losing her job (the latter having already been handled; the former in process) and basically starting over. all i have ever wanted to do is make things as easy as possible for her: i cook, i clean, i do laundry (we call me the housewife), everything so when she comes home from work she can kick her feet up and relax. to answer the next obvious question: yes, in the eyes of the government i am unemployed; however, i do small construction work and flip furniture and such to pay my bills and take her out when possible. she is the main bread-winner, though. here is where i really screw up: from time to time, i will just explode in anger and it is not directed at her, but she takes the brunt of it. the reason for my explosion is none of her doing and is completely my fault. there are so many times i feel she is out of my league (and, quite honestly, she is) and how i can do all of these little things yet, still, she deserves someone else that can provide these easily to her (someone like her ex-husband) even though we really are perfect for each other. i hurt that i cannot provide these things for her, but i try not to tell her because i know things are already hard enough on her as it is. i push it down, swallow it, and feel ashamed when i want to talk about it or even when she asks about it. after a while, though, my mind tells me ""you can't do this anymore; you deserve to be heard"" and i just erupt, taking out the last 26 years and all of the people that have wronged me on her. i literally lose control, yell, cry, and just become a monster. just the other day i almost lost her because i had a bout. i wanted to know if you guys feel this way, too: ashamed when you are down, not wanting to make your loved one hurt, yet the eruption is made much, much worse because you hold in something only in trying to make it easier on them. like i said, she has offered to listen, and i will talk a little here-and-there about it, but not about the daily struggle it is to live with, and when i do i'm hesitant because 1) she, too, has problems and 2) i can never really trust anyone (even her, who i trust more than any person i have ever known) because those that have told me they care or told me they will try to help always leave me when they hear about what i feel or tell me to ""get over it"" (this is mainly from my family); i've really had to deal with this all on my own essentially my entire life. i want to know if this is a normal thing, or if it is just me, because if it is just me then i will try to look elsewhere (i have a counselor but that interaction is limited due to cost/distance given the recent move in with my soulmate). what has worked for you guys if it is not just me? any and all input is appreciated because i can't afford to lose the most perfect and beautiful thing i have ever had in my life. thank you.",ptsd,4

4bb9a4e9-f043-46a9-89b9-b026578ed782,"anyone with post-traumatic stress disorder knows how flashbacks can interrupt and hinder lives. for those people without a knowledge of mental health issues, it can be hard to understand. flashbacks are more than just remembering the event. when a flashback occurs, like the name suggests, they actually take you back in time. now, this isn’t time travel; however, in your mind, it feels like you are reexperiencing the trauma. it feels like you’re back in that place. when flashbacks occur they generally happen because of a trigger. a place, taste, scent, touch, or some other sensation reminded you of your trauma and triggered the flashback. when that moment occurs you can no longer tell that the trauma isn’t over until you come out of the flashback. it feels like the trauma is happening again. there are some ways to ground yourself to stay in the present, and as you work through your trauma and learn coping skills the flashbacks become fewer and farther in between. it can take a while to get to that point though, and some people will deal with flashbacks for the rest of their lives. i’ve dealt with flashbacks of [my for a couple years now. it took me a while to get a grasp on them. when they first began, it took me a while to calm down and realize that i was in the present. i was not being raped again; it was just a flashback. now i’m able to bring myself out sometimes and i understand what is happening a lot sooner. i’m now able to use my grounding and coping skills to calm myself down. the main coping skill i use for grounding is stating where i am. i would say something like, “my name is caitlin. it is may 16, 2017. i am on campus. i am in my dorm room. the door is locked. i’m sitting at my desk. the lamp is on.[ is with me. i am safe.” doing that really helps me stay in the moment and be present. another coping skill i use is naming 5 things i see, hear, smell, and feel. that also grounds me in reality. the most important thing to remember is that the trauma is over. you might flash back to the past, but you live in the present. a flashback is so much more than a memory; it is a re-experiencing of it. however, it can be overcome. through time, therapy, and healing we can take back our lives.",ptsd,4

45b9d9e8-0390-4024-aef3-efb5c067490a,"hey all - this article was an eye opener for me and transformative for my recovery efforts. posting for the benefit of others: we can't keep treating anxiety from complex trauma the same way we treat generalized anxiety vicki peterson i’ve been living with the effects of complex trauma for a long time, but for many years, i didn’t know what it was. off and on throughout my life, i’ve struggled with what i thought was anxiety and depression. or rather, in addition to being traumatized, i was anxious and depressed. regardless of the difference, no condition should ever be minimized. if you are feeling anxious or depressed, it’s important and urgent to find the right support for you. no one gets a prize for “worst” depression, anxiety, trauma or any other combination of terrible things to deal with, and no one should suffer alone. with that in mind, there is a difference between what someone who has complex ptsd feels and what someone with generalized anxiety or mild to moderate depression feels. for someone dealing with complex trauma, the anxiety they feel does not come from some mysterious unknown source or obsessing about what could happen. for many, the anxiety they feel is not rational. general anxiety can often be calmed with grounding techniques and reminders of what is real and true. mindfulness techniques can help. even when they feel disconnected, anxious people can often acknowledge they are loved and supported by others. for those who have experienced trauma, anxiety comes from an automatic physiological response to what has actually, already happened. the brain and body have already lived through “worst case scenario” situations, know what it feels like and are hell-bent on never going back there again. the fight/flight/ freeze response goes into overdrive. it’s like living with a fire alarm that goes off at random intervals 24 hours a day. it is extremely difficult for the rational brain to be convinced “that won’t happen,” because it already knows that it has happened, and it was horrific. those living with generalized anxiety often live in fear of the future. those with complex trauma fear the future because of the past. the remedy for both anxiety and trauma is to pull one’s awareness back into the present. for a traumatized person who has experienced abuse, there are a variety of factors that make this difficult. first and foremost, a traumatized person must be living in a situation which is 100 percent safe before they can even begin to process the tsunami of anger, grief and despair that has been locked inside of them, causing their hypervigilance and other anxious symptoms. that usually means no one who abused them or enabled abuse in the past can be allowed to take up space in their life. it also means eliminating any other people who mirror the same abusive or enabling patterns. unfortunately for many, creating a 100 percent abuser-free environment is not possible, even for those who set up good boundaries and are wary of the signs. that means that being present in the moment for a complex trauma survivor is not fail-proof, especially in a stressful event. they can be triggered into an emotional flashback by anything in their present environment. it is possible (and likely) that someone suffering from the effects of complex trauma is also feeling anxious and depressed, but there is a difference to the root cause. many effective strategies that treat anxiety and depression don’t work for trauma survivors. meditation and mindfulness techniques that make one more aware of their environment sometimes can produce an opposite effect on a trauma survivor. trauma survivors often don’t need more awareness. they need to feel safe and secure in spite of what their awareness is telling them. at the first sign of anxiety or depression, traumatized people will spiral into toxic shame. depending on the wounding messages they received from their abusers, they will not only feel the effects of anxiety and depression, but also a deep shame for being “defective” or “not good enough.” many survivors were emotionally and/or physically abandoned, and have a deep rooted knowledge of the fact that they were insufficiently loved. they live with a constant reminder that their brains and bodies were deprived of a basic human right. even present-day situations where they are receiving love from a safe person can trigger the awareness and subsequent grief of knowing how unloved they were by comparison. anxiety and depression are considered commonplace, but i suspect many of those who consider themselves anxious or depressed are actually experiencing the fallout of trauma. most therapists are not well trained to handle trauma, especially the complex kind that stems from prolonged exposure to abuse. unless they are specially certified, they might have had a few hours in graduate school on cluster b personality disorders, and even fewer hours on helping their survivors. many survivors of complex trauma are often misdiagnosed as having borderline personality disorder (bpd) or bipolar disorder. anyone who has sought treatment for generalized anxiety or depression owes themselves a deeper look at whether trauma plays a role.",ptsd,4

477a7823-3158-4d44-9300-bcc81589bae3,"hello. i am a new poster and hopefully, am not in violation of any rules by posting this. my husband has been suffering from ptsd for quite a while now and it is becoming overwhelming for both of us. i’m hoping that by posting here some of you may be able to offer suggestions or advice on how we can deal with this. my husband was molested and raped as a child by his older brother on multiple occasions and then was again, molested as a teen right around the time he hit puberty at a summer camp. we have been married for over 10 years now and i didn’t know any of this until about 4 years ago. i hate that part of me resents that he never told me, but i have invested this much time and love him dearly. up until he finally told me everything, he had used alcohol, pot and anger as coping mechanisms. suffice to say, it was a very tumultuous marriage but since we have a young son, i stayed with him. it was one of those, it wasn’t always bad, so i could manage situations. as i mentioned, i found out about all of this nearly four years ago in a big blow out. i left and moved to my mom’s house with our son, and he wound up telling me in a vulnerable moment. after that our communication was better and i found myself making more and more excuses for his behavior because of what he had been through. it came to a boiling point in december of 2016. he had been having a particularly bad week and had been drinking heavily. some random conversation provoked him and he lashed out. there was a lot of yelling, which then turned physical. he had me pinned on the floor and my son saw it and screaming about “not hurting his mommy.” my husband had his knee on my throat, but i remember him saying something about killing himself. he got off me and grabbed a knife from the butcher block. he then screamed at my son saying something along the lines of “come here and watch this.” i was able to get my son quickly and get him to my bedroom. during this time, my son, the brave little guy, still had the soundness of mind to call my sister, who is a police dispatcher. he couldn’t understand what was happening, so he thought my husband was trying to hurt me instead of himself. since my sister was off duty so she placed the call to the police while we were up in my room. i heard him slam the front door, so i told my son to stay there and went down to check it out. he had slammed the kitchen knife into the wall and ran out to the woods behind his house. during this time, he had apparently called his sister to say goodbye. she called her parents and they called me. i was obviously on the other side of hysterical, but they got the gist of the story and called hubby’s little brother (who had also been through the same molestation and rape from their older brother). he was able to find him and calm him down enough to have him turn himself into the police. from there he was taken to the hospital for evaluation and was transferred to a mental health facility for about a week. at first, he was wholeheartedly opposed to medication and any kind of cognitive therapy but eventually realized that it had helped him. he was diagnosed with ptsd, depression and severe anxiety. he is now currently medicated and doing a lot better. immediately after we were visited by cps and went through the process of them ensuring that he was not a danger to our son – which was determined as okay and the case was closed, thankfully. the reason for this post is that through all of this (since he opened up about the rape/molestation) he has pretty regular nightmares in which he is relives the trauma. since this happened during a pivotal time in his developing sexuality, his body reacted despite his revulsion. he has been prescribed a myriad of medications to try and combat the dreams but not much has helped. it will work for a week to a few weeks, but the dreams manifest no matter what. he had been seeing a cognitive therapist, but she was not helping much. i personally believe that he needs someone who can get a bit deeper and work on the root of the problems and that the dreams are his subconscious’ way of screaming for help. he wakes up 5 nights out of 7 having relived the trauma in his dreams and lately has been vomiting every morning because he is so upset. i am at the point that i don’t know how to help him anymore. he has been trying to find a psychiatrist but, in our area, it seems everyone he has called has a 4-6 week wait time. he’s made an appointment but at this point, i’m not sure his mental health can last that long. he’s started snapping at everyone again, though he does stop and step back when i mention it, which is a vast improvement from before. he’s starting to not want to go to work (missing three days last week) and is just becoming more and more moody and depressed. i can’t go through what happened in december ever again. i won’t put my son through that. i don’t think we can wait for his next appointment. he has tried calling sexual abuse survivor hotlines and talking to people on the phone, but it doesn’t help. does anyone have any suggestions? i was thinking maybe a rehab facility where he can recover and focus on himself? i don’t know of many places like that on the east coast but maybe someone does? i’m trying so hard to support him as well as my family (a whole myriad of mental health and physical health problems) that i am wearing down fast. my main goals are my protecting my son from exposure (i guess is the right word), and making sure my husband can find some relief from the state he is currently in. i’m sorry if this post sounds whiny or pleading – we need help and it seems like there isn’t much out there in the form of medical professionals without a huge wait time. i am open to any suggestions! thanks! edit to add: i want to mention that i do not feel that me or my son are in any danger. if i felt that way, i would be gone in a heart beat. but i appreciate the concern from fellow users.",ptsd,4

8bc997e3-acd9-44ca-99cd-f7df4f2f6084,"i've recently come across this subreddit and i wanted to share my story incase there's anyone out there that has had a similar experience. i've been told it's a common thing for patients after long term hospitalisation to develop ptsd but i've never come across anyone sharing their story. the hospital story in brief detail: to keep the background info short, i was born with a genetic disorder that affected my liver amount other organs. in 2008 when i was 9 i received a liver transplant. the transplant itself went well but the aftercare did not. this resulted in about 4 years of living in survival mode, emotional abuse, what felt/feels like physical torture, and over 200 surgeries. between the ages of 9 and 12 i lived in hospital. hospital became my home my normal. everyday i would wake up not knowing if i would survive the day and if i did what horrors awaited me. you know the stories where the parents have to make the difficult choice as to if they want to try and keep their kid alive even though their life will be shit and filled with medical procedure after medical procedure, but their kid might have a chance at being happy? i was one of those kids and my parents made the choice to keep me alive, a choice to this day i still have a hard time deciding if they made the right choice. my mother could not deal with the fact she made this choice and this resulted in unintentional emotional abuse. when i cried after having yet another painful and invasive procedure performed on me against my will she would tell me to stop crying. she would get mad at me and say that crying is selfish because it just makes everyone else unhappy. now as an adult i realise this was a defensive thing not offensive. she couldn't deal with seeing me upset. she couldn't deal with the fact that maybe she was making the wrong choice, keeping me alive. this among other little gifts i have from my mother have left me slightly damaged in the emotional department but the real trauma comes from the medical procedures themselves. to put it brutally nearly dying was a regular thing in my life. a total of four nights my parents were told ""this is it. she won't make it through the night"" but yet i refused to go down that easy. while only four nights out of those years i was going to die, being in a state of dying was the norm. i was always fighting for my life, always dying slowly. out of a year i would be ""well"" for less than a month. but this was the peaceful part of those years. dying was easy and calm. living was afternoons of traumatic procedures that felt like torture. i knew then that those treatments were to help me but that doesn't stop it from feeling like torture. when your a child who at the tender age of 10 wants to just give up and die rather than to have to spend another 3 hours in agony having another tube shoved in your body and feeling it all because you've had so many sedatives in the last month that they no longer work and ga is too risky, it feels like your being tortured and the fight to live is becoming the fight to be allowed to die. there was also the mistreatment of doctors including some inappropriate behaviour of the sexual nature. the doctors would never listen to me or my parents when we would figure out what was making me sick that particular month e.g an infection. this resulted in surgeries and procedures that were unnecessary and caused more trauma. there was also the issue of budgets. the hospital budget wasn't great so corners were always cut which negatively impacted my health. methods of ""no touch"" treatment allowed drugs to be administered via iv without the full sterilised gowns, cloth guard and etc. this opened my already weak body up to more infections which contributed to a large chunk of my days spent in hospital. they also delayed and delayed a surgery to close up a literal hole on my tummy into my stomach in hopes it would close up on its own and they could avoid the expensive surgery and the embarrassment of a 10 year old knowing better than them. ( 2 months of me telling them it's not going to heal on its own and then eventually staying silent for the next 3 months waiting for them to give up and operate) this resulted in having to have a layer of my stomach removed from my skin as they had bonded together as well as on going digestive issues. the years of afternoon treatments, procedures and surgeries left me a little traumatised. during high school things weren't too bad. i had what i now know was anxiety, mild depression and the odd ptsd trip, but things were relatively ok. i was healthy for the most part and i was ok. until my last year of highschool. the brand of my medication was changed to a cheaper brand. this brand had some nasty side effects including the ones i was gifted, severe anxiety and depression. this triggered full blown nasty ptsd at least once a week, constant anxiety, extreme crying for no reason and the general feeling like my whole world just got blown apart and i was drowning. so much fun. when my family and i approached my beloved doctors and told them that i was getting these side effects we were told that's ridiculous. ""the drug is the same there's no way must be something else. maybe she's trying to skip school?"" assholes. we knew that the drug was different because we aren't stupid. after fighting this fight all my life we do our research plus a side effect of the o.g drug had disappeared with the new drug. eventually with the weight of a therapist we forced them to ""trial"" a different drug and away went my suicidal thoughts, anxiety and depression. unfortunately my ptsd stayed and therapy continued till the end of that year. i went to a therapist who diagnosed me with sever depression (at that time) and ptsd. she said that there were other issues to do with trust, not feeling listened to, as well as the negative messages about my emotions given to me by my mum and the feeling of being alone like i have to deal with everything alone. however the focus was on treating my ptsd with emdr and managing my depression. now i am in university at the end of my first semester. ptsd is still here and looks like it's not going away anytime soon but it's manageable for now. i'm still working through the negative messages installed by my mum on my own but overall i'm doing better than i ever have. has anyone had to deal with being traumatised from something that saved their lives? if you made it this far thank you for reading",ptsd,4

64903c6c-5b96-4a3f-aec0-ac7d57af5792,"i have ptsd from physical abuse at the hands of my father from when i was about toddler age to maybe 12 years old. my dad would hit me in the head with a closed fist in my scalp area, typically on the top part of my head. he would make a fist and stick the knuckle of his index finger out, with that he would hit my head with a punching/swiping motion. it always hurt, but sometimes i didn’t even know it was coming. sometimes it would make me see stars. there were times that maybe he didn’t think he gave me a good enough one, or maybe i moved away and missed his fist, and then he would hit me again even harder than the first time. i would always have sore bumps all over my head. you couldn’t see them, but could feel them. they used to hurt when i brushed my hair or if i put my head down in the wrong spot. the worst was getting hit on a spot that was already sore from previously being hit. it was not uncommon for me to get hit in the head every day. this was the only way that my dad disciplined me other than screaming or yelling at me. as far as my memories go back to my earliest age, i have memories of my dad hitting me in the head. getting hit in the head is an awful thing because you can’t really do anything to make it feel better. i remember how the pain would radiate to the very middle of my head and then keep “echoing” around until it finally wore off. i remember inspecting the sore bumps on my head with my fingers in class. when i was in elementary school, i spent a lot of time thinking about all this traumatic stuff that i wasn’t really able to process. much of the time when i was sitting in my desk during my school lessons, my mind was thinking about everything that was going on at home. one of the biggest complaints that my teachers had about me is that i didn’t pay attention and i was always daydreaming in class...and i always got in trouble for it at home. i got more bumps on my head because i couldn’t stop thinking about them in class. i never really did well in school. i always strived to do just enough so i wouldn’t get in trouble at home. i did just enough to get by out of fear. i have no idea why i’m even writing this. i wish i could write more, but i need to clean the house or my husband is going to be mad at me. i have just had a hard day...i know a lot of it goes back to getting hit in the head as a kid. i’m sorry if this type of post isn’t allowed, i literally have no one to talk to and i needed to express myself.",ptsd,4

would be good to get it out somehow. getting some closure on this? ___________________________________________ this letter is for you a. after all those years, i have been thinking about what i should have said to you if i ever met you again. its 6 years since we were together. 5 years since i got away from you. i wish i could tell you the damage you have done me, but i think you already know that. im now in trauma therapy for everything you did to me. once a week, i have to relive everything again. i have done this for almost a year now, and to realize what sick fuck you are have made me feel disgusting about myself. you made me believe that everything you did to me, was because i made you do it. if i only could be a little bit nicer to you, if i just changed a little so that you wouldnt beat me up or force yourself on me. how you almost killed me and yelled at me afterwards because i got scared while you almost chocked me to death. when i met you, i just moved to my dad because i got abused by my mother. i was in denial of the abuse, but i was hurt and depressed. i struggled with suicidal thoughts and believed my life wasnt worth living anymore. even when i got away, i was haunted by my mothers actions and harrassed by her a lot. you entered my life and seemed like the most amazing guy ever. you understood depression and how awful life could be. i felt we connected somehow. you were careful to begin with and i felt safe. i was shocked that someone was able to like me and love me despite the fact that my own mother never did. to get corfirmed that i was a lovable person did a lot with my self esteem. we got together. i was happy, my first boyfriend. you were quick and somehow i felt the relationship was rushed, but you were my first so i didnt know how relationship worked. you told me very soon that you loved me. you cuddled and kissed me all the time. eventually, you wanted to have sex. you had experience, while i didnt. i wasnt ready and told you that. you said it was okay and you respected my boundaries. as the weeks passed, you got more upset because i wasnt ready and at some days, you yelled at me and called me a lot of ugly things because i wasnt sure if i was ready or not. you always said you were sorry and that you had a bad day, your anger was sometimes hard to controll. i forgave you. i remembered the nice guy you were at the beginning and believed that this wasnt normal behaviour from you. how wrong i was. you got tired of waiting and after you drank some alcohol, you pressured me more and at the end i knew that my boundaries didnt matter. you told me it would be quick and that you would stop asking for it if i just did it now. i believed you once again, and i could feel me losing ownership over my own body. i was in pain and wanted to cry but i couldnt do that. because at the end, it was all about you and your needs. you were comfortable while i wanted it to end. i felt disgusting and horrible afterwards. the day after you wanted sex again. i didnt say anything, and you once again took ownership of my body and did as you pleased. i could feel my self be in pain and being uncomfortable. i told you to stop because i wasnt enjoying it. you didnt stop. you told me i had to last a little bit longer because you were so close. i felt overstepped. i started at the roof and saw the time pass by. you lied to me, because i had to wait for almost an hour before you finished. i once again felt disgusting and horrible with myself. you were happy, kissed me and told me it was good. i told you i didnt like it. you then told me i was weird because this was my first times and that i would eventually enjoy it. i waited for the day i would stop being weird and start enjoying sex. it never came. i cried multiple times after you were done with me feeling disguting with myself. you tried to comfort me, but it didnt work because i knew this wasnt the last time. it would happen again. i eventually learned that telling you no and stop didnt do any difference so i stopped. you broke up with me, telling me i was difficult to be with. i was the problem. my ptsd from my abusive mother made me more anxious and confused, i didnt understand how things were supposed to work. i wish i knew how sick i was and got treatment right away. after hearing my whole life that i was the issue, i believed you. after a few weeks, we were on a party together. you tried to have sex with me the whole night, and i pushed you away, told you no. you got pissed off and looked for someone else. i got sad because i didnt knew what was wrong with me. i drank a lot of alcohol in short time, and you came to me, said you wanted to talk with me in the forest. it was too loud to talk here. i followed you and believed you. the next moment i was on the ground crying and telling you to stop multiple times. i told you it hurt. i asked you to please stop. you didnt. you just had to finish. after that, you cried and told me you wanted me back. you showed me scars on your wrist. i was confused but said we shouldnt talk about that while we were drunk. the day after you told me how disguting and horrible i was and blocked me. we made up, and little did i knew how the abuse was going to escalate. you never let me sleep. you constantly hit me and forced yourself on me. every day, i woke up to my body being covered in bruises, while my face was clean from them. you were smart about that one. you wanted more and more from me and i tried to say no. you got pissed of and told me i had no right to say so, i didnt have a valid reason. you forced me to drink and once i was blacked out, you got it your way again. the only reason to why i remember this, is because i woke up later that night and remembered it. the memory was playing like a movie in my head. you threw things on me when i refused. i eventually started to realize that my life was in danger and that i had to run. you tried to kill me multiple times. while i waited for my moment to run, i had fo play along your games and just accept that i had to let you do anything to me if i was going to survive. i got away and i forced myself to forget. it worked for two years. suddenly i got panic attacks. i hyperventilated all the time while doing normal things. i was sure i saw you trying to kill me again. i saw you everywhere, and i heard your voice at all times. nights were horrible, i had to relive everything again. i stopped to sleep eventually because i didnt want to see you again. i was broken because of you. i was disguting worthless piece of shit because of you. no one would want me now after this. my later sexual experiences were affected by your actions, and i got raped again by the guy after you. i was never seen as a person. the last time i got raped was last year in april. at that time, it had been 5 years since i was with you. 4 years since i got away from you. i never got to escape from being raped, even if i ran away from you. i got enought and seeked therapy after summer last year. i wanted to kill myself and stop feeling disguting with myself and my body. i wanted to run away from the episodes playing on repeat in my head. i just wanted to stop everything. i never wanted to die, i just wanted everything to stop. emdr therapy has changed my life to the better. i start to realize that im not disgusting because of you. i cant blame myself for what you did. i couldnt change anything even if i wanted to, somehow it was meant to happen. the 15 year old i was never knew any better. now im 22 years old and i will call this experience a one hard lession about how life can be at worst and that i cant controll everything that happens go me. because at the end, the matter of fact is that i was never at fault for you being a rapist, no matter what i would have done different, it wouldnt change you being a rapist. because this is not about me. this is about you. you have serious issues with yourself. i have wondered many nights how you could have the heart to continiue to rape me even at those times i cried and told you no and to stop. no normal humans does that. i dont care if you got bullied at school and abused at home, because so got i. it didnt made me like you. we both have adhd, but i aint like you at all. adhd didnt make you a rapist. you did make yourself a rapist. it was a choice only you took alone, the choice to become a rapist. i have experienced child sexual abuse, i got bullied at school the most time, i got abused by my mother and stepfather, i got abused and raped by you, i got raped once again by someone else. but that didnt make me a rapist. you can blame everything you want, because at the end, i believe you do that because you cant handle the fact that only you alone chose to become a rapist. you were seconds away to become a murderer as well. those choices are only yours to make. how you treat other people is a choice you make. you know what you did to me. i am certain you know i struggle after what you did. why wouldnt i? im in a loving relationship now with someone that really loves me and respects me. i wish i didnt have to be bothered by your actions while im with this amazing guy, but thats what trauma does. it doesnt go away just like that. luckily for me, im in treatment and im starting to move on. im never going to forgive you, the only person im going to forgive is myself. im going to forgive myself for blaming myself for what you did. for every day i have believed i was disgusting and unlovable because of you. for being too hard on myself. for believing i could change the story if i did something different. for taking the blame only you should have been given in the first place. that i never let any of it happen, and that i only did what i had so i could survive. that i honestly believed that i deserved this when i never did. all the ways i harmed myself because i didnt want to deal with you. at the end, this is going to be a story i carry for ever in my life. just one sad story. its a part of me and never going away. im going to use my story to make something good. help people so that they dont feel alone. i have ptsd and earlier anorexia because of you. know the fact that while you have to live the rest of your life, knowing that you are a rapist, im going to live a beautiful life and do whatever i desire to do. while you have to remember me and that you raped me, im healing and starting to forget about you. you are going to see me smile and be happy, maybe you see me being happy with my boyfriend who treats me well. you will see that you are the problem, not me. im going to enjoy that. maybe we one day see each other again. i dont know. however, at that point, i have completly forgiven myself and you will still

b5c0b3ea-c1cf-49a6-b302-b53b3cc109c8,"not long ago, the power at me and my mom's house (i'm 16, live with her) went out, and was going to be out all day. my dad, who abused me in all ways except neglect, offered to let us stay at his house for the day while he worked so we could use his tv and do laundry since we don't have laundry machines. my mom agreed and we went over, but i hadn't really been in that house in months considering i was removed for above reasons. as soon as we were pulling up close to the house, i got hit by this dizzy-ing feeling. i used to get it in small spouts back during the cps process of being removed when i told my story or talked too much about something stressful, where i would kinda blank out and lose my train of thought. i would still be very much aware of what was going on, i felt real, i knew where i was and what i was doing, it was just like my brain shut down and i had to race to pick up where i broke off and get myself together. well, as soon as i show up its just a constant, non-stop feeling of dizziness and spaceyness. i would just stare at the ceiling waiting it out, wondering if i'd somehow been drugged by the water bottle i took from his fridge, even though he's never tried straight up roofying me before. i constantly felt like getting up and just going outside for fresh air and whatever was on the tv i couldn't focus on at all. when we finally got home, it slowly went away, but the next morning i felt it again and it carried on throughout the day. it was so bad i thought i'd hit my head or something, so i went to the bathroom looking at my pupils to see if they were looking weird, like some sign of concussion, and they were dilated as hell. i rush out to my mom and break down sobbing thinking i'm dying, but she tells me she thinks i'm having a ptsd response to being in that house again and my therapist says the same thing. i asked my therapist if she thought this could be some sort of dissociation but she couldn't give a clear answer, so maybe somebody who experiences dissociation can give me some clarification. i don't know if i appropriately tagged this as nsfw, but seeing as its my first post here, i wanna be careful.",ptsd,4

a3fb03b5-da02-475a-bdf7-5b87a84b0cc3,"i was perfect. i was uneducated, poor, dumb, abused physically and emotionally. my mom was in and out of jail, while me and my siblings were in and out of foster homes. we trusted no one not even each other, the system pit us against each other. the younger siblings were treated better then us older trouble makers. we were a lost cause destined to become like our mother. i resented others for ""having"", having love, possession’s, a stable environment. i never had friends growing up, i was awkward, i smelled and was dirty. i only had me to count on, and i always let myself down. i raised myself, no guidance, no consequences for my actions, no help when i needed it. i never thought more then a second ahead or behind. its very hard remembering my childhood, because as an adult its very disturbing, too disturbing to put into words. so i locked it deep down and lived in the moment. failed a couple grades, and finally dropped out of high school. my life seemed normal to me though at 17 no education, no home, no family, no future, no worries because i didn’t know i had to think about the future. i was at the mall one day after moving back in with my abusive mother who earlier in the day came into my room while i slept and started to pound on my face with her fist. i stood up to leave when she grabs my throat with her sharp nails, i punched her in the chest and left. i never hit a lady before or after but i was at my limit. as i was leaving all i heard was crying and yelling about how much she how much she hated me and how i ruined her life etc. well i went to the mall because i had no place to go, and i saw an army recruiter so i went up to talk to him about joining up asap. but because i didn’t have a high school diploma i couldn’t join without getting my ged. we talked bullshitted and boom forged paperwork. i got shipped out a week later without anyone knowing. i tried to quit basic over and over, fought everyone in my class at least once. the ones that were like me from bad neighborhoods we stuck together. but we were all too damaged to build any lasting relationships. when i finally realized after thousand of pushups that i couldnt just do anything i wanted to do, i conformed to be a good soldier. i followed every rule, stood at parade rest, stayed under the radar. basic was hard for me. i never had discipline or guidance. when mail call or we were allotted phone time i was always alone. i was damaged mentally, i hid my emotions and cried in the bathroom while shitting so no one knew. when i graduated and got to my first duty station we were told were part of the surge in iraq and would be deploying. i’m sure a lot of people had there fair share of mixed emotions but me i was ready. i was 18 with nothing in my brain except kill kill kill. i fought everyone in my platoon who had the balls to step up to me. my team leader and squad leader didn’t like me, i was hard headed, tough, mean, and vicious. i didn’t have a lot of friends just people who were around that wanted to not get beat up probably. so my unit trained hard for war. i am not going to get into details of every little thing that happened in iraq because well i was a young dumb soldier with no one to share my story with, so i never really cared about details of any mission or pictures of pretty much anything, i was just living one day at a time. (there are a lot of things i wish i had foresight on but well shit i am a little slow, there were a lot of things i didn't agree with that the army does but i went with it because orders are orders) so the first day we arrive to iraq we do a squad run. as we are running boom a mortar hits 25 feet away from us between to conexus. i cant explain the feeling i got but it went from quiet and peaceful to loud and chaotic fast. everyone was laughing and joking including me. we are finally here at war were infantry makes its money. our first mission was something else. it was a patrol with our platoon on foot. we were clearing houses, and it was hot. we were not prepared for this kind of heat. our soldiers kept falling out due to heat exhaustion, they were brought to the vehicles like it was a road march back home. i was angry. i felt let down by these men, giving up. i was tired, hot, and wanted to quit but this is a war zone there is no quitting in war. as we continue to clear houses we spotted an ied, we called eod and waited 2 hours for these fucks to arrive. when they arrived they traced it to a covering where we discovered a mass grave. humans laying on top of each other arms and legs twisted bodies stacked together. rough. eod couldn't disarm the bomb so they had to blow it with the bodies. when they blew it a stench took the air body parts were everywhere. i just starred at a head laying on the ground. with only half a face. i thought to myself this is sad. no one else seemed fazed by this. i just pushed it down deep. we were not stationed with the main battalion we built our own little post in baghdad known as a cop. we started missions to clear the area around our cop. day by day we would find ieds weapon caches etc. then one day we went to the fob where our main element was to get a hot meal, parked our vehicles and boom a mortar attack hit our parked convoy 1 person died and 3 were injured bad. i remember everything about that day. how we were parked somewhere else when our sgm made us move to that spot, i remember carrying my buddy to the tmc with blood flowing everywhere i remember them stripping him naked and seeing the open wounds from the blast and i remember how easy and fast it was for the doctor to leave my dead buddy on the table to help others. i gave up that day. something changed in me, i was ready to die, i was not scared anymore but expected it. i started to volunteer to kick in doors first carry heavy loads, do anything i could to be the best i could before i died. that night we went on a mission to clear some complexes no biggie we did it all the time. i was in the truck with the 240 machine gun over watching the road when our unit takes fire. the truck i was in was in the best position for suppressive fire and so the vehicle sgt ordered open fire to the main gunner, then we hear on the radio 2 people are injured and need evacuation so we prepped the vehicle for evacuation. 2 stretchers were getting carried to use when one falls, i jumped out the vehicle pushed the soldier aside and grabbed the stretcher carried the soldier to the vehicle where we rushed them to the fob. i’m looking at my medic doing all he can to try to bring this soldier back to life. he died while i sat there starring. he was killed by friendly fire. the 25 year old sgt who gave the order to shoot was shook to the core, and he was depressed. a week later a sniper killed him while we were driving down the road. the sniper started to kill civilians then chop off there heads and throw them at a mosque in town with notes not to help americans. this happened about 5 more times until we set up a ambush in the cover of night. i was south side security protecting the main ambushes flank. when daylight broke people started to become active and 2 older females in traditional black muslim attire spotted me, i tried to get up and grab them but they ran away to fast. so i fell back in a l shaped ambush so i could still protect the ambushes flank while moving from my compromised position. right as i set down my 240b me and my assistant gunner spotted 4 men walking in a military formation thru the woods were we used to be. we used binoculars and saw they had guns grenades and bulletproof vest. we reported it to our platoon leader who informed us to fire on his command, because north side security had the sniper in there field of view. so we let them come closer, i see the guy in the back point towards our position, the other 3 look back to see where he is pointing and we here the north side security fire on their target so i started to fire on the 4 men walking towards us 2 minutes of continuous firing then silence. we walk up to them and i see brains, eye balls, blood flesh everywhere. they had no chance, no idea they were going to die today. everyone was cheering dancing laughing even i was, this is an infantryman’s dream. later that night i couldn’t sleep. was i proud? i couldn’t answer it, but the army was proud, they awarded me an arcom with valor and i got a visit from general petraeus. after that night things calmed down tremendously until we left iraq. update 1. i came back from iraq changed, i spent 15 months of my short life in a 3rd world country ravaged by war. i lost 2 friends and killed 4 people. i saw multiple dead and disfigured bodies. i saw everything these people have been through. these kids getting blown up in the streets. mass murders, people being forced to fight us or risk there lives and/or there families lives. it was not only hell for us, it was hell for them also. i didnt want to kill any more and i didnt want to see anyone die anymore, so during christmas break while everyone was on leave i went to re-enlistment and told them i wanted to reclass into a different occupation. i was scared. i was quiting, like i always do, and thats something i have to live with. i left before anyone came back and before anyone could say goodbye. i liked it that way. i didnt have anyone anymore anyways. the next 4 years are boring i was on my own, got my ged and nightmares of me being in highschool in my military uniform stopped. i was excelling in the army i was promoted to ssg. i met my wife and got married. then we deployed to afghanistan together, and thats when i started to have flash backs. i felt uncomfortable, i started to cry all the time in secret. i couldnt stop being scared. the images of bodies, the scents, the enviroment, everything was right in front of me. i hid it and 12 months later deployed back home, where i sought help in private. (this is when ptsd stigma was still very real in the military.) it helped i got medications and talked it out cried and felt good for about 3 months, and then i would have another break down, and everything would start over again. but the next time it would be worst i would remember a little more, i would see another detail. i would think i was really there. how do you tell someone that? update 2 my wife started to notice a change in my behavior and asked me about it. so i told her about some stuff that was going on, not the super dark stuff. i told her i wanted to go see a therapist because i felt like i was losing control of my thoughts and emotions. i started to see a therapist which was very awkward for me. for one i am not the best at putting my thoughts into words. i stutter, and i have trouble finding words to use in different situations. i was always made fun of for saying stupid things, so i stopped talking to people and i started to think about what i was going to say before i said it, so there is always a very awkward like 2 second pause when receiving an answer from me. so i told the therapist about the war, how it effected me, and how i felt. he told me god has a plan for me. i felt betrayed by this statement, not because i dont believe in god but because i came to a therapist not a preacher. with all the things i have been through, and me taken peoples lives, i didnt want to know what god thought of me. so i left feeling like i had no place to turn. my past started to catch up to me when my mom started to call the cops and my chain of command saying i was missing and not calling her etc. she started to drunk dial me weekly, apologizing and the next day belittling me. my wife who had 2 mis-carriages was distraught, i was swirling downward fast, thinking of ways to end the pain. i had no place to turn or so i thought. i went to my msg and spilled it all. he understood helped me get help, was there for me like no one was before. this was the first time i felt like i didnt have to do this alone. i didnt have to be strong, i could be vulnerable, i could be myself. it was freeing. i guess thats how it would feel to have a parent you could lean on. i started feeling open and proud. i talked to people, things started to look up. my wife was pregnant with twins, we had a good savings, i was talking to a psychiatrist weekly, and my job performance was excellent. things were perfect. i started to have severe shoulder pain. i went to the doctor and found out i had a dead nerve in my shoulder causing the pain, and that they were recommending a medical evaluation board. the army retired me after 10 years. i couldve moved anywhere but i moved close to my mother because i wanted to reconnect with my brothers and sisters. i felt guilty leaving them in that shitty situation, while i went into the military. i still feel really bad that i wasnt able to save them from my mother. when we arrived home from the military my wife and i bought a house and started school. things were fine on the outside but i was just starting to get my stuff together in the army and i didnt want to lose all i had gained so i went to my civilian doctor. i told him i need someone i can trust, and someone that can help me continue to progress. he said he was all ears, so i told him most things. it felt good. he continued my meds and saw me twice a month. i was still very much struggling in college, so he sent me to a neuropsychiatrist and told me he was leaving. i was very sad to see him go because he was my rock outside the army. he left to another state and i went to the neuropsychiatrist where he told me i have a learning disability. after he left i tried to see another doctor but i didnt feel comfortable talking to the other doctors, they didnt like to presribe me my meds, and made me feel awkward asking for them. so i stopped going. i started to really struggle at school and home, and i knew i was losing control. i joined my battalions support page on facebook and found out 4 members of my company in iraq had committed suicide. i looked around at my family and i didnt want to be the next one. so i called the national suicide prevention hotline. i was scared i didnt want to become that guy who cant buy guns, or get a job because of this call you know. i didnt want that stigma to follow me for life. i guess i am still scared it will happen. but i called and they set me up with the va here where i live. i have an appointment in 2 weeks but am very nervous about using the va. i am scared because my twins and wife need me, and i am trying to be strong enough for them. i dont feel strong enough. i dont feel smart enough, and i dont feel worthy enough. i am trying my hardest to just be a good person, a good father, and good husband. thanks for letting me tell my story. if there is anything i may have missed or left out or if you have any questions for me please ask. as of this second i am feeling o.k.",ptsd,4

38d78ab0-79fd-409a-a9ee-93d55e4a45e3,"hello everyone! i have recently started going to therapy because i no longer could deal with all of the issues i was having with myself. a little backstory: when i was about 8 years old, my cousin who was 16 at the time had lived in my home for a couple of months due to problems at his own home. within the time he had stayed by us, he started to coerce me into doing sexual things with him. i vaguely knew what he was doing to me was wrong but i didn't fully grasp the extent of what happened until i was older and it haunts me and has significantly impacted the way i interact with others around me. what's worse is that barely anyone knows. not my parents, not my sisters, just 3 people that i've told. i didn't tell my family what was going on because i was afraid of what would happen. as a kid, i didn't like a lot of attention on me and felt that if i did tell someone, perhaps i would have gotten in trouble or people would starting seeing me differently. i didn't want any of that to happen. i just wanted things to go back to normal. anyways, i was more or less kind of dealing with the traumatic event by trying to block or suppress my memories of what happened. and it worked better on some days than others. it was a few weeks ago when i was at a gas station where i would often go with one of my parents. that day i was by myself because i had the car and wanted to just have a chill day at the mall. while at the gas station, this old man got into my space and hugged me and it looked like he was trying to kiss me so i pushed him off but after that i was just frozen. thank god he didn't try anything else on me. i was in my mind thinking how even after all these years, i still couldn't fight back and protect myself from situations like these. i was angry at myself for not doing anything. for the rest of that week, i cried my butt off. memories of what happened when i was younger kept reappearing in my head and i couldn't do anything about it. i had nightmares, i was snapping at the people i care about and it made me feel awful and realize that i can't do this by myself. i was sick and tired of having these nightmares and constantly being afraid that another male family member was going to assault me. so, i started therapy and it's giving me hope. having a name to what i've been going through for over 10 years makes me feel like i'm starting a new path in life. i knew that i wanted to tell my best friend this information-that i've been suffering with ptsd for a while-since she was one of the few people i've told what happened to me when i was younger. she messaged me today. and i told her my diagnosis . she didn't text me a response to what i said but instead called me. we had an hour long conversation- all of which she talked about her life, not once mentioning the fact that i told her this really personal information of my life. it honestly really sucks because although i know that she has stuff that she's been stressing about and whatnot, i just what at least an acknowledgement of what i had said. i'm always there for her and she knows this. it would've been nice to have some support on this matter at hand. i feel really bummed out because right now, other than my therapist, i don't have anyone to talk about this with.",ptsd,4

(i am now 21) it has been nothing like how i expected. i thought she’d be happy she got away. i thought she wanted to live her own life and be her own person. i know it’s only been 3 weeks but i thought she’d be better than how she is. i’m going to list it out, • between 2-5 am every day she will wake up screaming and crying. saying “i have to go back.” “i can’t stay here” “oh precious lord” • she tells me she had no one helping her to see what she had been going through. • she tells me she thought they’d get back together and be a happy family. • she tells me she didn’t know how long she’d be here when she left. • everyday she cries about how she can’t live here because my husband works, i’m in school, and she’d rather be abused than alone. • the only conversations she has with me are about my mother. i can’t sleep, i feel like i can’t breathe in my own home, and i make every excuse in the book to be away from the apartment. • she brought her 2 dogs with that she doesn’t take care of. they pee and poop in our apartment daily and she doesn’t clean it up or care because the floor of her house was coated in pee and poop. my grandma makes me feel like i’m worse than my mother. i’m doing my best to be a good person to her and a good support for her but i can’t. i made a lot of progress in the last few months and since she’s moved in i’m confident that i’ve gone backwards 30-40%. on top of it we are about to close on a ridiculously expensive condo where my husband and i have a strict budget where we’ll get $100 a week for food, clothes, toiletries, cleaning supplies, and anything else needed for day to day life and keeping a home. she expects us to pay for everything for her and has yet to offer to buy her own groceries or food/treats for the 2 dogs she brought with her. i feel like half the time i want to fake my own death, the other half i want the real thing. 24/7 i’m on call as a caregiver, a therapist, an assistant, a personal chef, a house cleaner, a money loaner, a lawyer, and dog walker. it’s too much. i cannot go out for dinner without her telling me that i know she doesn’t like to be alone and that she doesn’t just want to be at the house with my husband. she told me she doesn’t want me to go to my church. she told me she doesn’t want me to go to school. she told me she wants us to sell our condo before we’ve even closed because she has to live on the first floor and the third is out of the question. there is such an abundance of information here because i feel like i’m going crazy and maybe it isn’t justified and i just need to take a step back and calm down. but honestly i just don’t know.",ptsd,4

912058f7-b07f-477d-97fe-a46859ed2240,"okay so let's get one thing out of the way. i absolutely, unconditionally, fervently love my common-law husband. he's the only person i've ever been able to trust and the only one i've ever loved. we both have messed up pasts in that he has managed to choose women who use him, or are downright horrible excuses for human beings --his ex before the last was/is a narcissistic sociopath. myself, well, it's a long and complicated story. let's just say it's been very unstable from my very birth. i've been harassed, bullied, beaten, slandered... there have been attacks both physical and mental, assault, sexual assault, aggravated assault. all through my life, starting at childhood. i never spoke of it. it's true what they say... you can't just bottle it all up. it's like filling up a dog bowl with a garden hose; at some point it's gonna overflow. once that happens it's gonna be a mess. i kept it all in too long, and although i have *talked* about it, it hasn't been properly processed and now it's weighing me down. my ptsd and related anxiety took a turn for the worse a few weeks ago. i started feeling scared, nonstop, and constantly looking over my shoulder. for what, i don't know. then it got to the point where i am now. i'm scared shitless 24/7 for no apparent reason. every sudden move or loud noise makes me jump. all the time i feel like my chest is being crushed and my throat squeezed. food is like ash in my mouth; it sticks everywhere and i just choke on it and vomit. i haven't been able to eat in two weeks. i can drink only a small mouthful once in a while, or i'll throw up. it's like my body considers food and drink to be poison. i shake, i'm drenched in a cold sweat and find myself scratching myself all the time. i tend to hyperventilate and cry a lot. i've never been agoraphopic or anything, but now i can't bring myself to go outside. i can barely leave the bed --being wrapped up in a blanket seems the best place to be. so has been very sweet and supportive, until one night... he came up to the bedroom and started yelling at me how lazy i am and how he can't do anything because of my ""constant problems""... i began to cry right away, and this aggravated him even further. for some reason he can't handle me crying. he told me to ""get over it already, you're a fucking grown-up"" and how i'm ""always being sick or having problems "" and pretty much blaming everything that's wrong with the world on me. i tried to defend myself saying ""i'm not like this on purpose or something"", to no avail. ultimately he huffs and leaves me to bawl my eyes out. you know the kind of uncontrollable crying that actually hurts your innards and makes you feel almost desperate? that's what it was. i had some 10mg diazepams for my anxiety, and i started taking them one after another. i'd taken around 10 when i realized what i was doing, went to the toilet and threw up. i called the crisis unit, they told me to come in the morning. the next morning so was his usual self, like nothing ever happened. he drove me to the crisis unit and i've been here for 4 days now. he's visited twice. first time, no problem at all. yesterday... i was having a terrible day. i had slept for around 1,5 hours, having nightmares the whole time, i was feeling queasy and weak and generally like shit. tried hard not to cry. so wanted my opinion on something in his usual cryptic way (he may say something like, ""i saw a pretty nice car today"" and you're supposed to know which car he meant and offer your opinion on it) and my brain just didn't work. he went ballistic again, giving me the same shit treatment as before. ""you never have anything to say!!!"" eventually i started bawling again, then hyperventilating and my heart felt like it's going to implode (i actually have a heart condition). so grunted something like ""i'm not going to waste my time here, getting my nerves shredded to pieces"" and stormed off. i was sure he'd dumped me there and then. he did at least ask a nurse come see me. he didn't call, didn't text. i texted him last night, groggy from all the sedatives, saying i'm sorry that i can't be the person he wants me to be. he replied that he loves me, but i don't know. his behavior confuses me. one minute he's the sweetest, most caring man known to humankind, and the next he's the wrath of hell itself. i'm on the autism spectrum and i have enough trouble understanding people as it is. with my trust issues it's even harder. am i too much for him? if so, then what's the point. i don't want to be a burden to anyone or cause anyone any pain. i'm starting to feel life has nothing to offer me.",ptsd,4

8a6b0175-6614-4761-893b-b73b8adc981b,"hi forum again, i was just watching a comedian who was talking about how his mother used to beat him when he was a child. he went on jokingly as the audience laughed for about 15 minutes, describing how his mother used to beat him, and the problem with kids today is that their parents do not beat them like they are supposed to, and so they grow up spoiled and whimpy. and when i think about it, i know several people who had more abusive parents than i had, and they do not have ptsd, or any problems that i can tell - and they are doing rather well in their lives. so with them it does not appear to be one of those things where they are secretly suffering and pretending that they are not: they have good jobs, are quite happy, and seem only somewhat bothered by how violent their parents were to them. and a lot of comedians do joke about abusive parents, even sharing their own experiences, and they don't seem very bothered by any of it. and here i am, with objectively less severe abuse, and relatively few episodes of violence that i can recall, and i have ptsd from it all. i am very much not ok in my current life, i have major trust issues, anger issues, aggression issues, flashbacks, triggering episodes, poor stress regulation, an inability to relax, hyper vigilance, poor concentration, a lack of motivation, an inability to focus, severe dissociation problems, and all manner of psychological issues resulting from that abuse. this makes me feel very weak. i don't understand why people i know, (and comedians too apparently) have suffered objectively more severe abuse and more episodes of violence from their parents than i, and yet, have far fewer problems in their lives now. granted, i certainly don't know that about people i don't know, but there are people i know who seem to be doing very well in their lives, and i don't believe in dismissing that by saying to myself ""oh, they are secretly really messed up and they just hide it well"" when that would a blatant assumption of mine with no real evidence to back that up and much evidence to the contrary of that assumption that they are just hiding their issues so well. it doesn't help that some articles i've recently read that discuss why some people dissociate during a traumatic event more than others (and dissociating during the traumatic event is the biggest indicator of who will develop ptsd, as those who do not dissociate during a traumatic event very very rarely get ptsd afterwards) discuss that some people dissociate during a traumatic event more than others because they are ""more sensitive."" these stupid articles then go on to say ""oh but just because you are more sensitive and so dissociate more during a traumatic event does not mean that you are ""weaker"" it just means that you are more sensitive) and that really pisses me off. that is *exactly my point* on why i am feeling weak for having ptsd. because apparently, i was born ""sensitive"" and so i took the abuse more ""sensitively"" then others, and therefore dissociated and therefore developed countless psychological issues as a result of the abuse, when other ""less sensitive"" and therefore more robust and therefore stronger people, did not take their abuse so badly and so they grew up fine despite that abuse. that is exactly why i am feeling weak. because people i know, random comedians, and ""less sensitive/more robust"" people were also physically abused by their parents, and do not have ptsd or any kind of severe psychological distress in their lives in adulthood. so, yeah, i guess i'm just ""sensitive"" i.e. weak. i don't know why the articles try to pretend that a person's inherent ""sensitivity"" to trauma does not translate to them being weaker people, but that is definitely my perspective. if i have all of these problems resulting from my abusers' abuse of me, it definitely means that i am evolutionarily and biologically weaker and less psychologically robust than other people who suffered even more severe abuse in childhood and are not suffering psychological issues as a result. i don't see how the experiences of others and these articles on research of why some dissociate and develop ptsd while others do not dissociate and therefore do not develop ptsd, can mean anything other than that i was born weak, unresilient, and comparatively less competent than other humans at dealing with difficult or painful situations.",ptsd,4

(actually, stepparent but still counts right? 😞) and i can't be the only one who's child triggers their ptsd in some way. i was molested daily by my grandfather for roughly 10 years. during that time i told my parents what was going on, they spoke to him about it exactly twice to the extent of ""don't touch hasadigga like that it makes her uncomfortable"" when the abuse continued it became ""well just avoid him."" i was 12! so, as those of us with childhood trauma do, went from child to adult in 2.5 seconds. i've been with my husband for 6 years and his son was 8 when we met(he's now 14). lately my (step)son has been triggering me. that's a lie, he's been triggering since the beginning, but it's been ramping up lately. honestly i think it's because i'm jealous? jealous that he had absolutely *no* idea how fucked up the world can be. i have this absurd urge when he's upset with how ""unfair"" life can be (like when i told him he couldn't go to the park alone anymore cause he was threatening people who wouldn't play with him, cause that's a good way to make friends). i'm like do you really want to play the what's unfair game cause i've got you beat kid. and then i promptly feel like a monster no better than my grandfather. what kind of evil person would want to ruin the magic and simplicity of childhood?! obviously i've never said anything to him, his mother has poor parental boundaries and i see him worry about her adult problems and i certainly don't want to do that. but i'm horrible about setting boundaries. he has no concept of a personal bubble. how do i explain to him, without crying, that i love him but he cannot touch me without me initiating. i can't make eye contact and so i'm concerned that he thinks i don't like him cause i really don't look at him if he's looking at me, this has gotten worse lately since i'm more triggered. i neeeeeeeeeed him to stop touching me. i've even gone to cowards route and asked my husband to say something but, like the carefree child i couldn't be, he doesn't listen. how can i relay the severity of not touching without spilling the beans and burdening him with m my trauma? he himself had ptsd from a car accident two years ago, do you think i could say ""you know how you feel when we slide driving in snow? that's how i feel when someone touches me without my permission.""? i feel myself disassociating. i go right back to fight or flight and just freeze, focus on something else till it's over. it's my *exact* thought process from when i was younger. i'm concerned that i'll get pushed into a fight response and i have no idea what i'd potentially do to him, but i'm *much* stronger than him. so as a result i spend most my time in my bedroom or living room when he visits. i'm 28 and i'm tired of not feeling safe in my own home. it doesn't help that i'm living in the basement of the house i was abused in.

48b85a73-0297-4c58-8894-22332d6b5954,"2.5 years ago, i had a near death experience that landed me in a medically induced coma for 9 days. i thought 10 years had gone by when i woke up and i lost 30 pounds of muscle. that experiences also unlocked a lot of repressed memories for me. i was sleeping at most 4 hours a night, barely eating and i couldn't stand the company of others. i was a horrible wreck and barely able to function. 1.5 years after that experience, i was able to start therapy. i also went back to physical therapy and both of these therapists kept recommending a book to me about the impact ptsd has on us. it was written by a psychologist who has been treating trauma since the early 1970s, starting with vietnam war veterans, moving on to specializing in treating people who have been physically or sexually abused as children. it took me a long time to finally get this book. i was convinced the connection i had with my body was permanently altered because of this overwhelming experience. i could barely feel my left side, my throat was totally numb from the tube they had down my throat even 2 years later. the sheets of my bed made my skin crawl, reminding me of struggling weakly to move around in the hospital bed. i was too traumatized to believe relief was possible. then i started reading this book. maybe this wont be everyone, but reading this book makes me think that what is happening to me is actually understandable, its manageable, its treatable and its **not permanent**. i can feel more now, things are getting better, its easier for me to de-escalate the tension and stress i feel on a daily basis.",ptsd,4

""lets talk about your medical records, stranger!"" anyway, i just told her he is a ptsd service dog, which i shouldn't have even done.. to which she asked, ""do you have ptsd?""

(later an investigation revealed the truth) he didn’t think i would survive to tell the true story. the bullet hit the left side of my jaw exited out the right side and struck me in the chest. that was 2017, i’ve had multiple reconstructions over the years since and look amazing given my injury. last year i also made 98k gross so you would think i’m living great...however i’m still battling what i believe to be ptsd and it’s interfering with my life. i overwork myself to try to keep my mind off of the endless loop of replaying the situation in my mind and feeling the emotions boil up. when i talk to people i shove it too the back of my mind but it’s still there. i doubt anybody suspects that when i’m home alone i spend my free time listening to music slumped on the couch depressed. i feel spaced out often and sometimes it’s hard to feel genuine emotions other than anger. sometimes i get over whelmed by the emotions to where my hands start shaking. sometimes i feel violent, sometimes i feel like crying. everywhere i go i’m on edge and constantly feeling as if someone is going to try to hurt me. i have a 5 year old son who probably doesn’t know his dads having bloody memories of a gunshot running through his head while we’re playing. in my mind i’ve been shot and died a 10000 times. apparently i hide this struggle very well but lately i’ve been thinking it may be time to look for help, i forgot what it feels like to be a human without this violent baggage with me.",ptsd,4

388966da-d08a-405c-a47f-514b2b686ead,"sorry, this isn't quick. i need to explain. i've ptsd for a long time (caused by the death of two boyfriends, two children, cancer twice, childhood sexual abuse, physically and mentally abusive marriage - the list is just ridiculous). i had it under control, then i was involved in a car accident. i was stopped for backed up traffic, the person behind me hit me at 75 mph, spun me across the interstate and rolled down the embankment. woke up hanging from my seatbelt and my friend paralyzed (temporarily, but didn't know that then). it stirred up things i had settled. went to therapy, got everything settled (again). fast forward to a year ago - i get with this great guy. things are going very well and i'm finally happy. i start having paid from the cart accident again and i go to the doctor for a few more months. i find out i have a permanent injury they can't fix, amd the pain is persistent. this affects my 12 year career, changes so much for me, and i have trouble leaving it behind like i could work everything else because it's there every damn day. enter more ptsd: angry, irritable, need quiet time to calm down but i never get any, feel overwhelmed all day every day, and i never get a break from it. wonderful boyfriend isn't so wonderful anymore. he's one of those people who have had a mostly charmed life and never had to deal with anything especially hard besides the regular punches of life. i need his support, i need him to curb the triggers that he's able to. i need extra help while i get my shit straight again. but, he doesn't do what i tell him i need, then gets angry with me when i'm not able to keep things together (housework, cooking, laundry, my demeanor). i've told him how paralyzing it can be. i don't know if i haven't explained it the right way, or if he just doesn't care. i'm back in therapy, but every time i get a smidge better he's to the point he wants to break up with me and causes a setback. how would you handle this? how do you explain it so a complete outsider understands? how can i explain that the quicker he supports me the quicker we can get back on track without making it sound like it's completely his responsibility?",ptsd,4
46ea0d55-2509-4dba-bd60-4540fcb0c2b8,"i (25 f) have ptsd that results from being neglected by my parents (by mom is a bipolar alcoholic fwiw), a physically, emotionally, and sexually abusive ex who ended up stalking me around the time i was 18; a physically and emotionally abusive ex when i was 20-23, and a few non-consensual sexual encounters. frankly, i feel like i'm getting to the point that i can't date anymore. my trust issues have gotten so intense that it feels like i can't do hookup culture without either having a panic attack or dissociating. while i was dating my last ex about 4 months ago, i started having issues with my ptsd. when i had first told him about the trauma i'd experienced with my exes, he said almost nothing. in hindsight, that should have been a red flag for me. eventually i broke things off with him and he talked me into trying to work things out. while out on a date 2 weeks later i noticed he was pretty glued to his phone, i asked what he was doing and he told me he had heard a girl he had just seen at a party thought he was cute. i'm not really the type of girl to be jealous, but this irked me. i got upset, we got in a fight that night, but i thought things were for the most part smoothed over. instead a couple of days later he broke things off with me and he started dating her 2 weeks later. i'm part of a pretty close-knit art scene (and so is my most recent abusive ex), so i decided in order to confront my ptsd i had to call him out. the results were mixed, but the people who did support me were a great help. despite this -- i'm not sure i chose a good time (if there is such a thing) and it's socially isolated me a little bit, especially when it comes to dating. in the 4 months since i broke up with my last ex, i haven't been on any dates or kissed anyone or anything -- which is frankly very unlike me. i have self-confidence... i just haven't found anyone that i feel like won't crush me by not being able to handle my baggage or worse... will end up abusing me. how can i get past this? i just feel like waiting out this stupid hookup scene until people are ready to settle down. i've had so little stability in my life. tl;dr: neglected as a child and then abused by two exes. anyone i've dated that hasn't abused me can't deal with my baggage. how can i feel happy dating again without feeling like i'm concealing a big part of my life?",ptsd,4
2ee8b45d-7c4c-4e88-b48e-d696a8bb4ff4,"my husband and i got stuck in a negative cycle of communication that has resulted in him cutting himself off from me both physically and emotionally. we still are in the same house, same bed, and both active in raising our child, and have tabled all talk of divorce until later to give us time to try to work this out. the past few months of this have sent me into a ptsd spiral. i have had so many emotional flashbacks and negative thoughts paired with a severe fear of abandonment. i just want him to hold me and give me comfort, but he needs space and thinks i am needy and weak. meanwhile, i have started therapy and have my first true emdr session tomorrow. i am terrified. i want to know that he can be there for me when i get home if i am in a raw state or if i have nightmares, but that's not a thing he seems capable of doing right now. that's adding even more anxiety to my situation and i could really use any advice or suggestions to keep me calm through tonight and tomorrow (should it be difficult). my mother has offered for me stay at her house tomorrow, but i am also afraid that the different environment wouldn't be good for me either. i have my ""safe space"" and my ""protector"" and my ""comforter"" all activated, but i really just want some beer and cuddles and, for just this once, to not completely lose my shit.",ptsd,4
c6dee8f1-39c7-4237-80d0-c2af9b1fe3d7,"i’m really struggling at the minute with hypervigilance, i am often startled by the smallest noise or sudden movement, it will send me into panic mode before i even realise what it was. my thoughts don’t always turn to imagining bad things that might happen because of it, i usually swear but mostly it’s a physical reaction. my heart will beat faster, my breathing will be more strained. sometimes i am shaky. i need to know what is going on, what the time is, and a plan to a certain extent about what is happening. i don’t like things that are unpredictable. i hate waiting and feeling like there is a lot of time in front of me that i know i won’t be able to settle. another thing i’m wondering if is related to this is at night i find it hard to settle down with my boyfriend (of over a year and a half), i really struggle at times if i don’t know how the night is going to go and what he is doing, if we’re watching something, i am thinking will he fall asleep? will he want to talk after? will he want to have sex? (i can never initiate it) i analyse every little thing going on and can’t just relax and go with the flow. last night, we were trying to settle down earlier because we were suppose to be up early. we cuddled and watched something and i thought he was trying to sleep while watching because he wasn’t talking. i realise he’s still awake and i’m no longer paying attention because i can’t work out what’s going on and am getting frustrated by it. i don’t ask because it seems silly when we’re both trying to settle down and i shouldn’t need a minute by minute account of what’s going on in his head. i end up turning around to get more comfy because i’m getting more anxious, when it’s over i assume he is now going to sleep but he starts talking and trying to cuddle me and this makes me tense up more because i thought i’d worked it out that he was just going to try to sleep. i got annoyed at him because at the time felt like it’s him just being crap at communicating what his intentions are for the night and letting me know his plans even though now i realise there didn’t even need to be one. i didn’t expect certain things to be in this ‘plan’ at the time. i just got so frustrating not knowing what it was but there wasn’t one and didn’t need to be. being so anxious and tensed up, physical contact was also feeling uncomfortable so when he was touching me it kind of tickled and felt wrong almost but i was in too much of a closed up state to tell him this. i end up getting more and more tense and finding it harder to talk and respond but then when i try more to talk, he didn’t respond so i was analysing body movements, breathing etc to see if he’s just taking a while to respond or fallen asleep. eventually i realised he had and this made me more anxious. i got up and sat at the end of the bed because i couldn’t deal with constantly trying to analyse what was going on, if he was going to wake up, move a lot while cuddling me, wondering if he’s awake because of those movements. i couldn’t stop the over analysing. the not knowing. he woke up at one point and sat with me telling me he cares, he loves me and he’s always here for me. he is rubbing my arm which feels uncomfortable and telling me to come cuddle. i can barely speak i just feel so tense. i tell him to go back to sleep. he does soon and tells me to wake him up if i need him or want to cuddle. i listen to music, try focusing on the lyrics for a while and it helps me relax a bit more. i did want to cuddle, i just couldn’t because my body was fighting so much. when i did eventually feel ok enough to go back and lie down, i briefly wake him up so we can cuddle, and we did, me into his chest with his arms around me and i felt so calm, everything felt ok again, well for a few minutes. but having the cold at the minute, needed to get up to blow my nose and when i was about to lie down again, he said he was going to turn over which would be facing away from me. this kind of threw me back into the way i was feeling before and also rejected i guess, i can’t remember what i said but he ended up not turning around, had his arm around me who is not facing him anymore because i guess from him saying he wanted to turn around i took it the wrong way and defences went up. i ended up being up until 7am ish feeling so anxious and tensed up, my chest was heavy. i don’t want him near me because i can’t tell what’s going on, everything felt so uncomfortable. i wanted to feel loved and cuddle but i was fighting it so much. when i did eventually sleep, i woke up a lot one bad dream after another. still tensed up, still on edge, still not feeling like i could cuddle or deal with his touch as much as that comfort would have made things better. i am guilty of getting annoyed for no good reasons during the night. i just could not relax not being aware of every tiny thing going on and how it was going to go but i know it’s unrealistic to know that. i guess i can’t always realise that it is me that is being the abnormal one. today i got him to go out for a while because all day so far i’ve still been fighting it and just needed some time on my own to not have to analyse what’s going on. i haven’t been able to talk about it yet. it doesn’t always happen as bad or for as long as this. it doesn’t happen all the time and i love being able to cuddle and fall asleep with my boyfriend but when i am like this i do end up getting annoyed at unreasonable things and at times making it into his fault instead of realising what is actually going on in my head and body. i love my boyfriend so much and i don’t know what to do to help this. to be able to settle without needing to know every minute detail of what that means. i do find night time hard to settle down and more so than the rest of the day i guess i do analyse how the night is going to go more so, and it’s not because i think something bad is going to happen, i’m never in fear with thoughts of something bad happening, its physical and constant thoughts of trying to work out every tiny little details that are really unrealistic to know. any advice or reply would be much appreciated. sorry if this is all over the place, just trying to get things out as best as i can but it’s hard. edit: just to add in, i have just recently started trauma therapy. i am really trying to understand the way that i am and my behaviour to try to overcome things and be better at dealing with the way i am. during the night i have been reading up a lot on hypervigilance in particular. not really sure what i’m looking for in posting this either, i’m just not sure what to do.",ptsd,4
