8cfcfd73-a313-490b-909c-67a54de2e9f8,"the recent discussion about posts from people who've just started meds made me realize that it has been a year since i made my own [""i just started meds!!"" the last year has been quite a journey finding a med that worked well for me, but now that i have, it has definitely changed my life for the better. here is some of what i have learned from the experience: *finding the right med* * **don't assume what works best for other people will work best for you.** from reading here, i had gotten the impression that adderall was more effective than ritalin, and either was more effective than strattera. but once i started taking them, the opposite turned out to be true: strattera was very effective (but gave me bad side effects), ritalin also worked well (it's what i'm still on now), and i *hated* adderall (made me feel not-myself, somehow angry and emotionless at the same time). * **allow yourself time to acclimate to the meds before judging how they work.** the first time i took ritalin it was horrible, like my brain was a car trying to drive with the parking brake stuck on. by the third or forth time i took it, my reaction to it changed, and it started to be more helpful. * **what extended release format you have matters.** concerta and ritalin la have exactly the same active ingredient, they only differ in the release system. but the release system can make a huge difference in how fast the drug enters your system, and what dose you get throughout the day. for me concerta was ineffective in the morning (too low) and made me feel really stressed out in the afternoon (too much), but ritalin la felt like a good even dose throughout the day. * **too high of a dose can be as bad as too low.** on too high of a dose, i feel stressed out and overwhelmed - that stress reaction makes my focus and procrastination worse instead of better. *things that affect how your meds work* * **if you've just stopped taking something else, be aware that that may be affecting you too.** my psychiatrist told me to quit caffeine before starting meds, and dealing with caffeine withdrawal symptoms made my meds seem less effective at first. the same thing can apply when switching classes of meds - med b may not work so well for you while your brain is still adjusting to being off of med a. * **if you have other mental health problems, they need to be treated too.** my adhd meds are much more effective when my antidepressants are working well. sometimes it seems like my wellbutrin and my ritalin are working together to pick me up off the couch -- ""ok, you take her feet, i'll get her shoulders..."" * **sleep, mood, and exercise can all affect your meds. if you do not sleep enough, your meds are way less effective.** other things like being in a bad mood can also affect how well your meds work. and i've found that if i exercise intensely one day, my meds are more effective the following day. * **if you are female, your hormones can affect your meds.** i found meds did almost nothing during the luteal phase of my monthly cycle. getting on birth control pills helped even that out for me and make them effective all month long (but ymmv, some people find birth control pills make their meds less effective instead of helping). *what to expect from meds* * **meds can be subtle, you may not ""feel"" them.** when i take ritalin, i don't feel like i'm on something, i just feel like my normal self - but when i try to do something, it's easier to make myself do it and i'm less likely to get distracted or overwhelmed. * **if you have other mental health problems, treating the adhd may help with them.** having my adhd properly medicated has definitely reduced my depression and anxiety. * **meds will not turn you into someone that you're not.** if you don't like chess, then taking meds and sitting down at a chess board is not going to give you the motivation and focus to become a chess grandmaster. * **your achievements on meds are yours -- meds may have reduced the obstacles, but you are still the one who made it happen.** if you got an a on your math exam, that's *your* a. lots of other people could have taken the same meds and still not gotten an a. your talent and your effort are what got you the a once the meds reduced some of the obstacles. * **sometimes meds don't help as much as you'd hoped.** they improve my symptoms, but they don't make my symptoms totally go away. there are still things i struggle a lot with. it doesn't mean i don't care about these things - i want to do better on all of them and it upsets me that i don't - but i still have a brain disorder that makes me struggle with these things, and while it can be somewhat improved, it will never be ""fixed"". * **meds make you *able* to improve your life, but you still need behavioral strategies to help them work.** before meds, i had tried many systems for productivity and organization, but they always fell apart. it wasn't until i was medicated that i was able to start sticking to that kind of thing and making it work. and i do really *really* need my behavioral and organizational strategies for managing adhd - if i use my strategies my meds are a tremendous help, if i don't then my meds just make me slightly more alert while i read reddit, watch tv, and procrastinate. one year on, meds are still a huge improvement in my life. ritalin is just as effective for me now as it was the first time i felt it helping. if anything it's more effective, because i have learned how to work with it to optimize how it works in my life, and it has made me able to make some long-term changes like keeping a daily schedule. meds have not fixed everything in my life - my apartment is still a mess, i still procrastinate (although not as much), i still forget to do things, and i still lose my keys multiple times per week. but meds have helped me to improve so many things, to the point that ***i no longer feel like a hopeless fuck-up and i actually feel hope and confidence about the future*** (most of the time, anyway…). when i look back at [where i was i really can say meds really have been an amazing, life-changing difference.",adhd,0

d3f97ed1-e4e8-43a4-b245-06dcd28e555e,"hey guys, i wanted to share my story — not to brag or boast, but to offer a bit of hope for anyone else who might be in a similar situation. so for the last 7 years i’ve worked from home as a freelance writer, mainly covering music. it allowed me to work at my own pace, in my own comfort zone, and not have to deal with day-to-day situations that triggered my social anxiety (save for the occasional interview or gig, which always turned me into a nervous, overly-self-conscious mess). dream job, right? however, last summer i found myself desperately unhappy. like, crying-while-making-breakfast unhappy. i realised that as much as working from home sheltered me from anxious situations, i’d actually been hiding away from the world, from people/relationships, and from the chance to grow into the person i want to be (not to mention the opportunity to make a decent living lol). as “cool” as being a music journalist may have sounded to some people, the reality was that i was living a lonely, unhappy and unhealthy existence. something needed to change. it took me over a year to work up the courage, but last month i finally applied for new writing jobs. even reading through the job descriptions filled me with anxiety and dread. *must be able to work to tight deadlines under pressure. ""*ohhhh fuck 😰,"" i thought. but i was determined to fight through it. last week i got my first interview for a copywriting job at a digital marketing agency. my first real job interview *ever*. my heart was pounding out of my chest from the minute i woke up to when i arrived at the office. i was absolutely terrified of blushing during the interview, stumbling over my words and the manager noticing i was clearly not a confident or capable candidate. it’s the most nervous i’ve been in a long time. somehow, i managed to get through the interview (which lasted 1 hour and 30 mins!) and make a good impression. a *really* good impression, in fact. the manager called me yesterday and offered me the job! 😁 he liked that i even remembered peoples' names, which i generally make an effort to do, if only to avoid looking like a forgetful clutz. i guess anxiety *can* be a good thing! i start the job next month and i’m already super nervous, but i’m also really proud of myself. a few years ago i would be too anxious to even google “job search” for fear of being taken out of my comfort zone. these last few weeks i've learned that that fear *is* conquerable, these fears are mostly a fabrication of anxiety anyway, and there are far better emotions and feelings to be found beyond that fear. life is too short to live miserably in the shadows. i don’t think i would’ve had the courage to make this change if it wasn’t for a few things: &amp;#x200b; * meditation. i like to use the [calm which has a whole range of emotion-specific sessions and series (calming anxiety, boosting self-esteem etc). the one about confronting difficult emotions was especially helpful on those days i *really* didn’t want to think about job hunting. * mood board. make a photo album of things that make you happy — people, places, possessions, memories, movies etc. i’m most anxious in the morning, so looking through my mood board (while listening to feel-good songs) every morning really helped to lift my mood and confidence to start the day. * make a list. write down things you’ve done in the past that you’re proud of, things you’ve achieved, challenges you’ve overcome, no matter how silly or small. remind yourself that you *can* be confident, you *are* capable, and you *do* have value. * find inspirational people. for me, learning that bill hader (the super funny and seemingly self-assured actor/comedian/director) has struggled with anxiety all his life — to the point where he’d get physically ill in the days leading up to *snl* — but has still been able to find success in life, is totally inspiring, in a weird way. if you do one thing today, watch [this video of him talking about his * [owning it: the anxiety a super insightful, relatable and inspiring podcast on all things anxiety, hosted by irish author caroline foran. i only discovered it a few weeks ago, but it has already given me so much useful information on how to manage and overcome anxiety. thank you to anyone who has read this far. however bad your anxiety may be, there is always hope.",anxiety,1

4958f5ae-67fd-46a6-831c-5841a3ca2ffe,"travelling off-the-beaten-path can be good for many reasons; “unspoiled” nature or charm, peace and quiet, photo opportunities without people getting in the way, more chances to talk to locals instead of staying within foreigner circles, cheaper entrance fees or restaurants, less touristy souvenirs and junk shops… but i’ll start off by saying that **this is not an “attack” on the-beaten-path travel**. there's a reason why there’s a beaten path, maybe because those monuments or sites have a lot of history and were important before international tourism was a thing, sometimes a place is simply very cool and everyone wants to go there, sometimes because it’s easy to access from the capital or along the way between sites, and it can be very good to visit the known places because it has signs in your language if the language barrier is something that makes you nervous, you don’t have to worry about getting lost, it’s your first time abroad or in that country and you aren’t ready to go off-the-beaten-path yet… and many of us just want to see machu picchu and the eiffel tower regardless of crowds or how “typical” it is. **there is no one right way of travelling**. my reason for making this post is simply because many times it can feel like we’ll be spending our time surrounded by crowds, or we’re questioning whether that cultural theme park is really our best option to get to know a country’s culture, or the sites just seem really expensive and there *has* to be a cheaper option, and sometimes it can be hard to know where to look to find these alternatives. here are some ideas on how to find some new spots: ## **discovering new places** **1. use google maps** i use google maps for everything. when i say “use google maps”, i mean this in many different ways: - **create a world map** and continuously add places to it, regardless of whether you’re planning a trip there. for example, i see a photo of the [csav in chile and i think “i’d like to see that!”. but by the time i actually go to chile, possibly many years from now, i’ll have forgotten the csav even exists. this is why, when i hear or see something i like, i put it on the map and it makes sure i remember them when the time comes to visit that area. [this is my current world - if you’ve already started planning a trip, **know where the places you’ll be visiting are**. “i was thinking of sleeping in tokyo and doing day trips to kyoto and nara from there”, as a japan travel consultant i hear things like this all the time, it’s because people haven’t really looked at a map. this can be helpful not only for understanding the geography and locations of the sites you’ll be going to, grouping sites together by areas so it’ll be easier and quicker to move around between them, but also to find other places along the way. say you’re going from beijing to shanghai, they’re far away, there’s probably something interesting to do along the way! what other stops does the bullet train do? do any names stand out on the map? is there a strange colour or water formation that looks interesting? sometimes you can simply ask someone who knows the country well: “hey, are there any worthwhile stops between shanghai and beijing?” - **look at the icons on google maps**. i was adding the notre dame in paris to my map and i realised there are so many things to do in the area, just by [looking at the i hadn’t heard of le palais du luxembourg, place dauphine, institut du monde arabe, musée carnavalet… these may not be off-the-beaten-path, but it’s still a quick and easy way to discover things. &amp;nbsp; **2. let images guide you** - the first thing i always do when starting to plan a trip to a new destination is open google images and type in “(country) tourism”. so if i’m planning a trip to slovenia, is what’ll come out. lake bled, piran, skocjan caves, ljubljana, styria’s wine fields, postojna cave and kamnik are places that i hear about first of all. now that i know something about the country, i can add these to my map if the photos look interesting (i don’t research anything about them yet, i’ll do that later, this is purely judging from an image search) and i’ll have enough for the next steps. - look up the places individually. often when you google a place, other suggestions will come up. for example, [here i am searching for the viti and, as you can see, at the top there are other recommendations: hrossaborg horse city, hverarönd namafjall […], myvatn nature baths… these are sometimes things that others have searched for when looking up the viti crater, sometimes they can be nearby spots, sometimes it’s places that aren’t even in the same country but are similar… open them all! [the can be used similarly. - related to above is another google images feature, [“related when you click on an image. make sure to look at the different images featured and often the title or description will have the name of the other place. it’s a good way to find similar places often at the other side of the country or simply cheaper / lesser known. after about an hour of doing these two things, is what my map of iceland looked like, pink the places i thought were really cool, they’ll be my must-sees, and brown the regular-cool places to visit if i have spare time. - **search for abstract places**. “vietnam waterfall”, “algeria caves”, “germany modern statues”… whatever! you know what you like, so search for that thing specifically. i always search for ruins and caves and history museums. many of these sites may not appear in guide books but they are often worth a visit because you’ve searched for that thing knowing it was something you’d enjoy. - not just sites, but **restaurants and/or hotels too**! just search “tanzania restaurants” and you can find some amazing for foodies especially, sometimes making a visit to a town or city especially so you can eat at that specific place can make the trip much more worthwhile than if you’re simply going with what you find next to the museum. - **use the local language**! if you’re going to france you can search for “cave”, but searching for “grotte” may give you some different options. - **get lost in pinterest**. once you’ve found a cool image on pinterest about the country you’re going to, just let yourself wander around looking at the other images and places you’ll find there. i especially like pinterest because they are images posted by people who have no clue about the place (and i say this with all the respect in the world, it’s an advantage!). even though pinterest is full of this image, nobody who goes to japan would actually go to the [spiral simply because it’s in the middle of *nowhere* and many people (who don’t use pinterest) don’t know it exists. because people of pinterest haven’t been to the places they post, they are not suggestions “tainted” by how easy or difficult it is to visit them, how close or far away they are, how expensive it is, etc. they are purely suggestions based on how good they look. if that’s what you’re looking for, not biased opinions but simply *places*, then this is one of the best options to look. &amp;nbsp; **3. just ask people!** this may seem very obvious, but i think sometimes many of us forget to do this, simply ask people who know the place well or live there what their favourite places are. i live in barcelona and every autumn i make a trip to i also really like [la fageda d'en i don’t know if foreign visitors go there often, but i really think they should if they like nature. people who know the country will know about places that tourists don’t. &amp;nbsp; ## **making the most of your trip** **1. determining your must-sees** what i like: traditional architecture and history (especially prehistory), volcanoes, caves and rocks, temples (bonus points if secluded), ruins and castles, listening to people speak other languages (actual interaction not required). some will think that once you visit one castle then you’ve kind of seen them all; some will visit some ruins and stay there for under an hour because “there wasn’t much to see”; some will prefer to simply read the pamphlet at the entrance instead of building family trees and timelines before their trip; some will get frustrated about the lack of communication and signs they don’t understand or not having anyone to talk to when they travel alone to a foreign country where nobody speaks your language. i don’t like bars and pubs because i don’t drink, amusement parks are terrible because they’re expensive and i’m scared of heights. i don’t want to waste my time at beaches abroad considering i’m from spain and spend almost half the year at the beach anyway. that’s okay! other people’s tastes will be different, that’s the whole point, *people’s tastes are different*. don’t be afraid or embarrassed to say “nah, i’ll pass and do something cooler for me”. **you have limited time on your trip** and you should spend that time doing something you really enjoy. don’t add places that people say are “must-sees” to your list simply because they’re *supposed* to be really good, go to that place that you thought was interesting, even if others will shrug at it. i think this is the most important thing about travelling: **do what you love above anything else**. i made this mistake many times on my first solo trip, and sometimes i still think “well, it’s really famous, so i should go there”, but i can confidently say that my favourite places are the ones that i went out of my way to see simply because *i* was excited about them. this doesn’t mean going off the beaten track is best, sometimes what you’ll want to do is visit a very common place, and that’s a good option too, just make sure you’re visiting that place because *you* want to, and not because other people say it’s really good. **there are no universal must-sees, only personal ones**, you can’t do everything so choose what you love. somewhat related to this is another point: **people have different budgets when travelling**. i’m a backpacker. i’m not going to pay 29,000 yen for a jr pass to ride the bullet train up and down in japan, that’s about the amount of money i spend for 11-12 nights in a hostel. i’ll use the night bus and arrive to kyoto at 5am with a crick in my neck but *for me* it will be worth it, what a bargain! others wouldn’t dream of travelling like this. it all boils down to **people having different priorities**. think about what your priorities are. &amp;nbsp; **2. avoiding crowds** people-watching can be entertaining, but sometimes we just really want a place to ourselves. there are many ways to go about this, even for the most famous sites. - the easiest way is simply to **wake up early**. if it’s a museum, residence, castle or any other place with an opening time, you’ll want to be there as soon as it opens. if it doesn’t have an opening time because it’s outside, it’s a building, observation decks and scenic views, etc., go even earlier. many people don’t like waking up early when they’re on holiday and tour buses tend to arrive around 10-11am. sometimes this will work and sometimes it won’t, but i’ve found that it is generally the most successful way. - **go when nobody else wants to go**. is it raining? fantastic! few tourists go outside in the rain, make the most of it and go to all the outdoor sites then. - **backstreets exist too, go for a walk!** i often walk to a site if it’s around or under 30min instead of taking the bus, sometimes that’s more interesting than the actual site itself. - **the closer to the capital, the more popular it will be**. i say capital, but really any popular destination city works. for example, everyone goes to the blue lagoon in iceland, but there are similar alternatives for hot spring bathing around the country. if that’s an option for you, perhaps simply go out a bit further. &amp;nbsp; **3. travel isn’t only about which places you want to see, but also about experiences** do you have a bucket list? perhaps you should. many people don’t like them, but i personally do, this is just a suggestion. a bucket list isn’t supposed to be a checklist, it’s a reminder. it doesn’t even have to be in the form of a list, it can be a folder on your computer full of images or ideas, it can be a folder of newspaper cutouts, a blog where you repost interesting things you want to do, etc. i mean things such as “use a pottery wheel; learn how to snowboard; meet a nun”. something i’ve always wanted to do is throw a message in a bottle into the sea. i took the ferry from italy back home and i realised later on that it would’ve been a perfect opportunity to try it out, but i didn’t remember at the time! doing these things in a different country can be more exciting than doing them at home, because it’s a moment in which you have the time to try new things. when you travel, think of things you want to try and do, not just see. &amp;nbsp; **4. travel ethically** i won’t get into this too much because everyone draws the line in different places when it comes to morality, this isn’t supposed to be a controversial post. but i want to at least mention it because i think it’s quite important. nothing is going to ruin your trip more than coming to spain to see bullfighting and ending up upset because you didn’t know exactly what bullfighting in spain is like, or riding an elephant in thailand and later learning about what happens behind-the-scenes. are you buying your souvenirs from someone who is harming the local community or economy by importing products or underpaying their workers? are you visiting an aquarium that gets its dolphins from the same people who kill and eat dolphins? are you going to shifen in taiwan to release paper lanterns without having in mind the serious environmental problems that these lanterns suppose? it’s impossible to know about everything, many times you have to look this up yourself because nobody is going to tell you, but especially when it comes to animals; try to know before you go. &amp;nbsp; well then, this is where i end my monologue. i hope this has helped any of you who may have been having trouble planning a trip, or at the very least start an interesting discussion in the comments. if you feel i missed anything important, feel free to add below!",none,5
c78bd8d6-c9ae-4947-a876-59d7302ed80b,"i live in america. last year i went to visit my grandma in the netherlands for a month. when i got there, the first thing i noticed was how clean and orderly everything was. the houses were very nice, the architecture was modern and beautiful, and to me it felt like i was in the future. when i got back, i began to notice that everything seemed very dirty and run down. i was noticing a lot more how the roads and sidewalks were discolored and dirty, the buildings were in poorer condition, and how everything in general just felt... worse. it almost felt like i was in a slum. of course america's standard of living is very high, but compared to the netherlands, america (or at least the city i live in) seems very run down and filthy. i got used to it after a while, but i thought it was interesting how it really puts the incredibly high standard of living in the netherlands into perspective. has anyone experienced something similar? if so, what country do you live in and what country did you visit?",none,5

860fb783-c9be-4bfd-a592-4d81b60e4de8,"several of you have probably at least heard his name associated with the red hot chili peppers, and justly so. many would say he's one of the greatest band guitarists of all time, and he is, in my opinion, the greatest modern guitarist. but too few know that after he split from the band around 2008, he's had a killer solo career as well. generally his songs have a mellower, sometimes more acoustic sound than rhcp's funk, but they're just as engaging if you're in the right mood for them. this jibes quite well with his role in the band as well, because he was always the one bringing the melody to rhcp's otherwise funky sound, and his eccentric, reserved personality always had a way of showing through in interviews, live performances, and even music videos. his replacement in the band, josh klinghoffer, was introduced and more or less mentored by john himself, and he is a very talented musician in his own right. even so, somethings clearly missing in today's chili peppers. each lineup they've had has given them a bit of a new identity, but rhcp as most think of them couldn't exist without john and the chemistry he had with chad, flea, and anthony. just now i was listening to one of his solo songs, titled the will to death, and i just felt so overcome with emotion. i was reminded of what a shame it is that more people aren't familiar with the works of one of the greatest singers, guitarists, and lyricists i've had the pleasure of hearing, and i felt compelled to make this post. if other frusciante fans want to share their favorite songs or anything that they appreciate about him, please go for it. edit: some of my favorites here's one he collaborated with klinghoffer on. not my all time favorite of his, but the crescendo it reaches toward the end is brilliant and their voices go together very well. murderers, falling, and wayne have no vocals, but the guitar work is brilliant enough that they don't really need any. this one's pretty underrated, even compared to his other work. /u/matwick reminded me of this /u/jeffersonfull reminded me of this which reminded me of this /u/young_ed mentioned this one, a bit slow, but well worth it and that reminded me of this song as recommended by /u/comala93 will post more as they come to mind he's also very impressive live. he's got some great covers not to mention his performances during the standard rhcp fare. there's also fan made frusciante site at i've never looked much at it, but it might be a neat thing to check out if you're interested in him.",none,5

3617a7bf-427c-421c-ae01-21dc3e762f1e,"from floating islands of plastic to mountains of discarded food, humankind seems more and more to be smothering the planet in our own waste. the consequences are devastating, not just for ourselves but for every species sharing the planet with us. the scale of the problem might make it seem insurmountable, but a solution presents itself. the bulk of this waste is in the form of hydrocarbons, which need not be seen as just harmful pollutants; the technology exists to upgrade organic waste into high value products. gasification readily converts most hydrocarbon waste products into synthesis gas, a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen which in turn acts as the feedstock for fischer-tropsch synthesis, yielding valuable products including liquid fuels and pharmaceutical waxes. with the right expertise and technology, we can therefore view most of our waste as a commodity rather than a threat. here at unisa’s materials and process synthesis unit we have developed a complete end-to-end process for the conversion of waste into fuel, all mounted within a standard shipping container. we believe this portability is the key to getting this technology where it’s needed most: the sites where waste is produced. we are professors david glasser and diane hildebrandt, directors of materials and process synthesis at the university of south africa and we will be back at **2 pm edt** to answer your questions. ask us anything! it's 11pm here in south africa, so we're going to call it a night and come back in the morning to mop up. thanks everyone for your questions and thank you to the moderators for providing the opportunity to do this.",none,5

d2b9f8df-545c-4042-9cb2-cc60683d256d,"i guess i’ve been told by my family and stuff that people with issues like mine are “wallowing in self pity”, being dramatic, and that happiness is a choice. i’m so afraid i’m choosing to be like this. i’m even more afraid that there will be some easy fix and then that will prove to my parents that i was just being dramatic all along. for example, if my ptsd suddenly starts getting better then i feel like everyone will be like “oh she was just being dramatic like we thought.” it makes me feel like shying away from potential treatments because what if all this time i’ve been making all this up? what kind of person would i be if all this time i was just “milking it”? i am being active in treatment, and i’m even trying a emdr if i can get an appointment with the place closest to me. i’m going to continue doing therapy, but that doesn’t change that my brain tells me “you’re just faking it.” i’m not sure if that makes sense but i hope it does. does anyone else have this? i could use some words of encouragement",ptsd,4

d85f16c3-0638-471d-809b-6f3db4d21b29,"i get it, i already know what some of you might say, the memories make you who you are. unfortunately, i don't think this is the case for me. i have complex ptsd stemming from multiple childhood traumas and a few adulthood traumas. i'm 25. if i put my back ground story on here, it would have to be a book so i'm not going into it. repeated abandonment from both parents both in childhood and in adulthood. i recently, this year, with my therapist backing up my decision, had to finally sever ties for good with them both for different reasons. neither of them were ever truly in my life aside from a year after my grandma died, i tried to let my biological mother into me and my sons life because i promised my dear grammie i would try. it didn't work out. i might still run into my biological mother at school because we attend the same college for the same degree (i very much dislike this, i was already halfway through my degree when she started) so there's always a chance i will run into her at school (already happened once, she tried to talk to me and i threatened a restraining order), there's always a chance i'll even be scheduled a class with her. my father popped back up creeping on my facebook and ""liked"" something i made public for professional networking purposes and brought a whole wave of panic and anxiety crashing down on me. after publicly denouncing him, he finally conceded and said that i wouldn't hear from him again. i hate that i had to make the decision to end whatever half ass (or lack of) relationship i had with either of them. many times, i can push it to the back of my mind but unexpectedly it comes back up, and it just rips right through me. i love my life right now. i've never had it better than i do now. i've been through divorce, failed relationships, a lot of moving, and making sure i don't fail a college class in between it all, all with zero family support (i haven't failed a class btw, which i'm very proud of, 36 credits in despite the chaos). after a stint of being single/dating non exclusively and figuring out the kind of man who i truly want, i'm finally where i want to be in life and i finally feel like i'm on the right track. my kindergartener goes to a blue ribbon school, i live in a nice area with my boyfriend who treats me with love and respect. he's given me the gift of time by not needing me to work so i can finish school faster and he has faith in me. my son is tested gifted and is excelling in school, getting involved in sports. i have cats that i adore and a king size bed. i feel stable in my life. so why can't i completely be happy? why is my happiness sometimes hiding behind a dark cloud? because of memories of my parents. even the rare good memories are painful because the bad memories greatly outweigh the good. i don't want to erase my whole past, being abused in foster care, etc. just of my parents. it crushes me that they both ended up living off of the same main road 30 mins from me and also happen to live in the same area my long time best friend lives in. they are so close but they can't be a part of mine or my sons life for so many reasons i don't even want to get into. i'm starting to feel a bit of that panic just writing this out. i just don't think i can ever be truly happy because of them. today was the worst episode yet. my sons dad picked him up and my boyfriend went to work. as soon as i was alone, i started pacing the condo and ended up sitting in my sons super cool batman bedroom. i looked around and just broke down. i screamed out loud to them, why couldn't at least one of you have done this for me? i never give up, why did you have to give up on me over and over again? i just completely broke down sobbing into one of my sons stuffed animals and just crying why over and over again. i felt really tired afterwards and took a nap. after that (and taking my anxiety meds) i've felt a lot better. but that pain....it's so sudden. it's so intense, it just rips me apart until i feel absolutely helpless to it. i don't want to erase all my bad memories....just the memory of my parents.",ptsd,4
