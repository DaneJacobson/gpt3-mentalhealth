289150ec-1ebd-44e0-9211-91feb57ef122,"all my life i’ve noticed that it’s hard for me to put time and effort into friendships, but sometimes i’ll even fixate on one person i guess until i move on to someone else. i never did this on purpose or to be hurtful, if anything i’ve usually noticed people move on from me if that happens. this didn’t really hit me until this past year when one of my friends called me out on this and even if it hurt at first i realized they were right. i also find it hard to have the motivation to see if i want to hang out with some friends and i often as myself if it’s worth the trouble or anxiety to try and do so. i just always worry that my friends might find me too overbearing or annoying since sometimes when i’m too happy to be around someone, i do get hyper. i guess my point/question is how am i able to find a happy medium with friendships and social skills that seems to come naturally for nts? it seems like they don’t have as much of an issue as those who have adhd/other disorders. i just want to be able to hang out with people more often (finding the motivation i guess) without worrying if i’m being too much or anything of the sort.

7a94c538-d2e9-40a5-8595-72a8695263ed,"i'm having complicated feelings here. my husband is thankfully getting better but has been sick for the last month with what we suspect is covid. (he had a negative test, but has all the symptoms. we are in a hard hit area and i've never seem him this sick this long including 2 visits to urgent care / er. we just went for antibody tests today.) more recently he has been complaining of brain fog and feeling mentally slow and forgetful. for the last couple of days he'll make flabbergasted remarks like, ""oh my god! i walked into the room and couldn't remember why i came in here! can you believe that?"" and ""look honey, i set my water down here and i forgot where i put it."" and then, ""i went back into the kitchen for my water and i still didnt bring it back, just my coffee."" he says these things with a mix of disbelief and humor, while at other times he expresses a lot of anxiety about these and other symptoms. this is... such a mixed bag for me. i've been really worried about him and i'm really glad he's getting better. i'm still worried because he's usually very organized and it's true, any change in cognitive function can be a cause for concern. especially because he's been dealing with a ton of obnoxious and scary and ever changing symptoms for a month and counting. most of the time i've been reacting with humor as well. but i've also been saying - ""you mean you dont usually do that?"" and, ""you know, you are basically describing things that i do probably 20 times per day and have always done for my entire life. welcome to my level!"" it's strange to me that this seems so remarkable to him because it is so everyday for me. i am also having a hard time because, while things have gotten a lot better between us, we definitely have a history of him criticizing me for this exact type of thing. setting things down and leaving them because i've forgotten about them, getting off track and delayed because i'm not totally keeping track of what i'm supposed to be doing. he's always been the more organized and disciplined one. part of me wants to scream, ""now you know how it feels!"" of course, i dont know what it feels like to have covid or whatever bug this is since i didnt get sick, so maybe we're like even?",adhd,0

""why yes, i'll continue to gorge myself on junk food and watch shitty youtube videos instead of getting actual work done."" it also has the added benefit of making the meds useless, so hooray for thumping side effects with no actual benefit. if i don't prioritize sleep, i can basically guarantee that *nothing* i'm supposed to get done the next day is happening. finally, as the added *coup de grace,* lack of sleep makes you procrastinate on everything, *including going to bed to sleep.* i swear, talk about a disorder of vicious cycles.",adhd,0
8e6fdd2d-bf9d-47b2-ba8f-62eafc5e8aaf,"my 8 year old son was formally diagnosed with adhd earlier this week and prescribed vyvanse. i have been in almost daily communication with his teacher this year as we've tried to help him get through the school year, so i let her know that he had taken his first pill this morning. she sent me feedback this afternoon that he worked great in a group today, he wasn't distracted by the other kids around him, and he found something out of place at recess and put it away which is incredibly observant and out of character for him. he also got all his schoolwork done on time, which is a major struggle for him. when he got home, he told me he felt smarter today and i noticed immediately that he isn't getting distracted in the middle of his sentences and taking a lot longer than others would to say what he's trying to say. he seems more direct. and guys.. i'm freaking crying. this is the boy i've always known he was, coming out of the fog. i'm sure this is not the end of his journey with learning to live with adhd, but it seems like a milestone. the fear and worry that has been weighing on us both as he fell farther and farther behind his peers is a little less today and i'm so thankful for it.",adhd,0

0d29d7b2-814d-4331-b054-d011a5e42b34,"i have always struggled to sleep since ever. and when i started medication this only got worse. i quit medication a year ago, and sleep got slightly better. but it would still take me 2-3 hours to fall asleep. then, about a month ago i hit a brick wall of stress, guilt and bad planning. i went on sick leave for 2 weeks. during that time i improved my workflow / todo list and i started meditating using the headspace app. (ios) the app teaches you to relax and be mindful. basically it tricks you into calming down. and two weeks into the training, i started falling asleep without effort. none. i just do the routine from the training and i fall asleep. it is like magic. sorry. but this is a huge thing for me. maybe it can help you too, so i wanted to share. and just as a disclaimer, i have no idea how or why this works, or if it's some placebo effect. but at this point i don't care. because now i'm even more calm and less hot headed during the day. and i can sleep at will. at will!!! :d and one more disclaimer: i've read multiple sources say that this kind of meditation can surface buried mental issues / traumas. so that's something to keep in mind if you want to try it out. edit: just to clarify. this isn't a learn how to sleep app. it's an app that teaches you to meditate. and it's that knowledge that has enabled me to sleep, not the app directly. i don't use it at night.",adhd,0

8c0b3da0-08b3-47e2-b6e7-c8aff952b338,"so it finally happened. i couldn't keep putting out the little trail of fires i was leaving in my work and they just caught up to me and burned me out. however... i'm reacting a lot better than i thought. i told my company about my adhd after i was diagnosed. i was diagnosed just before christmas and i told them shortly after. i was being completely honest with them, i told them i wanted to have it out in the open, and for it not to come up during a situation where it would seem like an excuse for something (at the time i was holding things together quite well) they were quite supportive and they asked me for info or advice regarding it. afterwords i was able to get back into a really productive flow for about a month, i was working so god damn well and i was the happiest i'd been in a while in regards to my work. i couldn't keep it going come the start of february. things started to slip and i basically shut down. i was so worn out that i was getting constant headaches and i felt physically sick. i'm not on medication so it wasn't a side effect or anything, it was stress. i was trying so hard to keep that enthusiasm and that level of work. cut to today, i had a meeting with my manager and we were talking about the past month, all the slip ups and issues that happened. things i honestly thought i had done, but were embarrassingly not even partly finished. she handled the situation very, very professionally. we spoke about the fact that it is in no way a reflection of my character, she said i'm a very good fit in regards to the teams dynamic. but that the inconsistencies in my work were a problem, which is fairly obviously true. we're a client facing company, my inconsistencies and my slip ups have a major impact on the reputation of the company itself. so after some more discussion we came to an agreement that for both parties it would be better for me to leave. i understand the role, i know what this job entails, and i do agree that it is the right decision for myself and for the company at the current time. i like to think when i get things under control that i could come back and truly be able to do my job consistently, i like the team, i like the perks of the job and the experiences that come from it. i'm going to use this as a reason to really evaluate what i need to do with myself. this is the first time where my adhd has put a roadblock in my way as opposed to a hurdle. so i'm going to use this time to either find a way around it, or i'll just find a better road.",adhd,0

21140c33-7443-42b7-9461-b74bf3fcff6c,"that psych today article was an anxious read for me because it was too on point. it’s so accurate— it’s scary, but also relieving because i know i’m not alone in feeling like a deadbeat. i hate being perceived as lazy and acting lazy when my mind is actually moving so quickly that i can’t keep up and i’m full of enthusiasm for novelty but i can’t channel that into real life activity or sustain an activity over the long-term. social anxiety is part of the reason, but the underlying reason is that i lack the self-control and intrinsic motivation others seem to have. i just want constant stimulation and dopamine. maybe i just don’t have enough adversity in my life to drive me toward a goal. i did fine in school because i was fast and the work was easy. as long as i had a structured environment, i could kind of keep it together. as soon as i leave the structured environment and go home, i’m a mess. my self-direction compass is spinning out of control and i’m stuck in place while time is flying past me until it’s time for the next obligation i’m already thinking of excuses to get out of. --- i stopped feeling like i’m performing at the level of my capability right after puberty— i became apathetic, listless and just did the bare minimum to get by. there was always this mental fog i had to fight through. i knew i was different, but i believed i was special which was a big mistake. every time only in hindsight did i see how much better i could have done if i could have put in the effort. i was ahead and doing great in school— until i suddenly wasn’t and from there it’s a blur. even if i’m being super productive, i will eventually get bored with the activity and move on. the more effort i put into it, the more resistance i will meet the next time i try to initiate the activity. i like the comparison of add to having a ferrari brain with bicycle brakes. i get depressed when i notice my enthusiasm peaking and motivation dropping off too quickly as if my brain doesn’t have enough juice to get to the finish line— or any finish line ever. i’m bored and i want to quit while my mind refreshes and searches for a new thing to fixate on and obsess about. i’ll probably come back to that other thing later to not do it some more. i can’t direct my attention to the areas of my life that actually need it. i can’t even direct my attention to the things i enjoy that used to distract me from all this— but that’s more depression related. --- at some point in the last year, i had the sobering realization that sitting in front of my computer for over 10 hours every day (which was my normal for the last 10 years) is obviously the largest factor exacerbating my feelings of misery, isolation and poor health while being unsustainable. the thing that brought me safety, comfort and joy in the past is now sapping me of my life force. at some point i went from enjoying my me-time living vicariously through tv show characters and distracting myself— to feeling like i’m just hiding from the world and my stomach goes into a knot thinking about all the loose ends and unresolved stuff hanging there. i’m even a little afraid to go walking around outside in my city for fear of running into someone i know or my ex because he lives in the neighborhood. i don’t want to explain myself to people anymore. life is not about closure though. i just get so stuck on something it consumes me. then i let it go entirely and move on to the next thing. i hide because i don’t know how to cope with my feelings and i don’t trust my judgment anymore and i’m afraid to leave my comfort zone. it doesn’t help that my mother picks up all the slack around the house and i do wish she wouldn’t because it keeps me complacent but she knows i’m depressed so i guess i should appreciate it. she’s always coddled and sheltered me so it’s her second nature to nurture, soothe and take care of her only child. she felt like she had to compensate for my father’s absence but she could never be strict/i didn’t take her seriously so i turned into an entitled self-absorbed know-it-all. now i look at my mom and think she did a good job raising me to be a good child— but parents should raise their children to be good adults. it’s as if i’m missing a key piece of the puzzle for being a regular person and i still act like i did when i was a teenager. as long as i live with my mother, i feel like a kid. i haven’t had a normal routine since a very long time ago. every morning i wake up feeling the dread of uncertainty thinking about how much i’m not going to get done today and how i’m tired of being me. --- when i was 18-20 my plan was to go backpacking through europe right about this time. i imagined i would have a job with a skill that i taught myself and i thought i would grow out of my bad habits and magically acquire willpower one day. my parents never validated my feelings. they ignored my low self-esteem and avoidant behavior to keep emphasizing how normal i am and how i should just relax and be normal. i have dozens of bookmarked guides and resources for a ton of different projects that i’ve wanted to start for years but i’m more skilled at organizing and categorizing things into lists of lists and more lists instead of actually doing them. i don’t follow through. i forget. i get bored. my eyes glaze over and my brain says “next thing! go-go-go now! no time!” even playing video games or activities i used to love— i feel guilty because i know i should be getting my life together but i can’t fight my brain or overcome inertia. i should be advancing my real life self instead of hiding behind an online avatar and peeking over my screen out the window peering and hissing at all the happy people living their lives in ignorance and bliss. i thought i was so mature as a kid and now i feel stunted. in theory, i love to read and learn and i have a curious exploratory mind but when i try to execute something i don’t follow through. “i’ll do it later,” i say about everything but “later” for me is anytime between 1 minute from now and the year 2052. about 10 minutes in— my eyes glaze over and my brain switches to battery-saving mode but i’m still reading the physical words which have lost all meaning before i jump up and run off to do something else. and then i’ll lie. i’ll lie that i did do the thing that i only half-assed. i’ll lie that i did something instead of nothing. i lie to avoid or get out of confrontation or impress or divert the conversation. i cut corners and then lie. in social situations if/when i feel comfortable, i can talk to people like they’re my best friends but once i’ve learned enough about them i get bored and disengage— even subconsciously i’ll just displace the person into my peripheral vision because i need a new source of stimulation. i don’t really think to reach out and call or text first. i let a lot of time pass worrying i’ll be rejected until it’s too late and rejection is inevitable. time is so elusive in my world and i guess people really don’t like to wait. i’ve let many fair-weather friends slip by this way. i wait for others to reach out to me instead of being the initiator because then i feel wanted. probably something to do with fear of rejection. it’s not even a normal organic fear— it’s a conditioned fear and a remnant from my childhood. i always thought i was impermeable to bad influences because i swore to be the opposite of my father and learned what not to do from him, yet here i am— stuck in a similar pattern. scattered, disorganized, frustrated, bored with self-defeating tendencies and all. --- in my mind, all scenarios always end in rejection, disappointment or some negative perceived slight on my part. i pay attention to perceived slights intensely and often in my daily life. pretty much after every interaction, i go over it in my head and think of all the ways i may have offended them and all the reasons they now hate me. i blatantly avoid contact with people and think they don’t notice but they do. the ones that take it personally probably really do end up disliking me because they’re just reacting to my reaction to them. i’m just now realizing life is whatever you make it. if you walk around with a dark cloud over your head all the time, it’s bound to cast a shadow on those around you causing you to internalize their reactions which are just projections of your own insecurities in the first place. if you’re confident and comfortable from the beginning of the interaction, then everyone else feels comfortable to let their guard down and you establish common ground. i can feel the tension in the room when i walk in pretending to be nonchalant, praying that no one addresses me or tries to make small talk— while in the process alienating myself from everyone in the room by creating an almost palpable mental separation of ‘me vs them’. it’s always like that. someone once said i always look like i’m having a bad day. when i get on the defensive, i start looking for things about them as kind of collateral in case of emergency. i do this with everyone. i’ll pick up on something they say and throw it in their face later when we’re arguing about something. for every criticism directed at me— i have ten up my sleeve for them before i start to dissect their personality and get really mean. i realize how manipulative that sounds but these are all defense mechanisms i developed in order to cope with my environment. i’m still acknowledging them and acknowledging just how tightly wound i am. it just doesn’t occur to me that other people are just as alive and stuck in their bodies like me and we have more in common than i like to think but i need to create a separation for some reason. i fall down the rabbit hole and i feel like i’m not ready to face the world, that i’m ugly, that i’m stuck in my cocoon, that it requires this immense exertion to socialize, that i just don’t have ‘it’— and even worse when i’m in a social interaction where i’m made to feel inferior/criticized even a little— i shut down and pull out the superiority card in self-defense. i’ve always wanted to fit in and not be singled out while simultaneously craving being the center of attention which i was with my friends. then i feel bad about being manipulative because i’m not actually a sociopath and i desperately want to connect to people; i just don’t know how to do it correctly. i was raised without many boundaries and not believing in boundaries has gotten me in trouble. i feel like i’m physically exerting myself to act normal around people while they can just let themselves ‘be’ effortlessly. why i’m so ashamed of myself— i don’t know. --- maybe i’ve just normalized so many negative habits and disproportionate reactions while developing brutal defense mechanisms. i always feel hostility in social environments— probably because i always feel vulnerable and social interaction feels like taking a personality test. like in the break room at my old job, i would brace myself before entering the room— heart pounding, palms sweaty— hoping for only a few people. i try to maintain a neutral expression but i’m hyper-aware of all my movements, how my hair is sitting, people standing in my profile and staring at my flaws or if they notice how nervous i am and smile meekly at me like i’m about to pounce on them. if someone asks me a question, i may stutter and then they think i’m an idiot and lower their speaking pace and emphasize important words like i’m a toddler, which just irritates me more. i just can’t let other people see the real me. it’s like i feel obligated to keep it a secret for no reason but it feels like the biggest secret ever. i just have so much needless self-loathing and shame covered behind a thin veneer of false confidence. i feel bad that i have nothing to show for myself after being an adult for 5 years. i know a ton of useless shit but i’ve never produced anything or developed and nurtured an employable skill because i don’t have the discipline/willpower for it.",adhd,0

29e426ea-2a92-4c9f-99bd-a24600cbc300,"a couple of days ago, i posted about the adhd depression loop, and how easy it's to get sucked into it. i did wanna make a small guide on how to get out of it based off my experiences. i am currently escaping that loop and i feel like maybe my insight might be appreciated for first time loopers or in general. 1. **recognize you're in the adhd depression loop:** if you got this far, congratulations. now that you know you're in the loop, you can get out. it sucks to be here, but fortunately, you can escape :d 2. **note that you are talking yourself down:** you will be unnecessarily harsh on yourself for every action you do. whether it is an adhd symptom or not. even if you're mad at yourself for good reason. part of the issue is sometimes, you will write off the actions you do chalking it up to the person you were. you will basically [be like this] ) (it's a clip from bojack horseman). ""wow im a dumbass who can never get his work done."" even if you feel that this is true, you are in dangerous territory of allowing yourself to continue being that person. 3. **come up with ways to stop talking yourself down:** to be honest, i don't know how to get rid of that inner voice. i do have ways to suppress it though. first off, being aware that the internal voice is doing you more harm than good already somewhat diminishes the effects of it. recognize that you aren't that person that the inner voice describes and you are going to be someone better. yeah, adhd gets in the way, and the general predisposition to depressive episodes, but those aren't you. those are obstacles you have jumped over time and time again, and you can do it once more to get what you want. 4. **tell yourself you are great and can get out of this:** it might feel disingenuous. if you have a hard time having an inner voice tell you that you are great, write it down, say it out loud. chances are you have fallen trap to the adhd depression loop before and you have gotten out before. you can definitely do it again. even if you haven't, you're still an amazing creative person that can get out of this rut. 5. **set up small goals:** another way to help is to make your checklists or task list or whatever you do to make sure you are doing work consist of smaller goals. brushing teeth, showering, getting out of bed. when you check those off, you might feel like you have momentum for getting through the rest of the day. even if you don't, the very least you feel is some sense of accomplishment for winning the small battles you face every day. even if you fail those, you aren't destined to be the person you were yesterday. 6. **move onto the bigger goals:** once you said you were amazing a billion times, and finished the smaller goals for a while, start stacking up those task lists with more stuff, and fill your day with things you have to do that you feel you are capable of doing. don't forget to schedule time for yourself and reward yourself for completing the work you set aside. don't be too harsh on yourself when escaping the loop. sometimes the responsibility that we have given ourselves while we were stuck in the loop seems overwhelming, but take it day by day at a time, and one day, maybe we can get out of the loop my friends. also, remember to seek professional help and therapy if you do really feel you need it. there is nothing wrong with therapy, and i find myself in a significantly better mental state when i am consistently going to therapy.",adhd,0

b26378cb-4859-45df-8ef7-cc8d27f4e784,"hey guys, my largest problem in managing my adhd is undoubtedly procrastination. now the annoying bit about procrastination is that it isn't an adhd symptom; it is a type of behaviour you learned to cope with having adhd. so popping meds doesn't solve procrastination, because it isn't a symptom. i've been struggling with it for a very long time, but recently i attempted to approach my tasks in a different way which has really been effective for me. i still have shit days on which i just never get started, but they are becoming less and less common. so to understand this approach and why it works you gotta know that most procrastination stems from perfectionism. i hear you go: i don't have perfectionism, i screw up plenty and i'm lazy as hell. but perfectionism isn't: you actively try to do everything perfectly. it's: nothing is good enought *unless* it is perfect. that creates massive pressure for yourself, and this makes you procrastinate. ok, understanding that, let's move on. the reason i personally procrastinate is because i look at my end point; my assignments, my tasks, my emails - all things that i have to hand in, do, or send to *other people*. it's that i am so hyperfocused on the quality of my result, while i totally forgo any effort of dealing with the process of getting there. not only that, but if you procrastinate like me, your sense of responsibility is heavily geared towards responsibility *towards others*; teachers, employers, et cetera. so everything is external rather than internal. we focus on the goals not the process, and we focus on what we have to do for others rather than what we value ourselves. so as an experiment i tried to switch it around. i tried not to focus on the quality of my goals, but on the process, the minute-to-minute doing-of-work, to determine whether i was doing well. i tried to shift my sense of responsibility towards myself, towards whether i thought i had done all i could; not to what an external authority figure would say. instead of feeling ""i have to""-pressure from others, i would *choose* to get to work. basically, my goal for a day was to feel happy when i looked at how i had spent my time. *not* all the goals i might have completed, although that also helps. just putting in the time. and it really does work. it isn't magic or anything, and of course such a thing as a lasting mental shift is just something that slowly develops, but i've had more good, really productive and stress-free days than i've had in ages trying this. so to sum up my advice: * goal vs process: don't feel good about end results only, focus on puttin' in the work. * responsibility to whom? don't do it for someone else, do it to make yourself proud. * selfworth: let it be determined by time and effort invested, not by whatever finish line you thought up. * choose: this is a cliché but i really think you should never think in terms of ""i have to"". you don't *have* to do anything. you choose to do something. now i think a theme you might notice here is that it all goes from external to internal. it moves from outside to within, both in a social sense and in a temporal sense. from external authority figures we move to responsibility towards yourself. from goals and results far in the future, we move to putting in the work (without feeling the massive pressure of those goals so much!), right here and now. from feeling good only when we hit the finish line and hand in that thing, we feel good by being busy *doing* that thing. that's a bit counter-intuitive. when we think about procrastination, we think: *i* don't want do do that, *i* first want to do some of this. so how can all this centering in on myself and on now be even remotely an antidote to procrastination? i dunno. i think it is because we *think* procrastination is a selfish activity; we choose to do something fun rather than what we *ought* to do, but really, procrastination isn't selfish at all. because at the end of the day you feel like shit about yourself and you'll be underperforming. procrastination isn't selfish; you're hurting yourself. so yeah i dunno. give it a shot maybe. do the work because you want to feel good about yourself at the end of the day, not because you're trying to force yourself to get to work. oh shit i forgot to mention that part, but i'm not gonna revamp this post now. the whole idea of this approach is that you *reward* yourself by thinking ""shit i really put in some time today, go me"". because i usually tried to force myself to get to work: ""if you don't do this shit you'll be in serious trouble!"" that shit doesn't work and it will only make you very very tense. keep it light i guess. good luck to you all. disclaimer: i wrote this post while procrastinating lmao",adhd,0

b4b4e135-506b-4459-841d-b0903be0cde8,"i've been recently diagnosed this month with i-adhd. i've started on 5mg of adderall up 3 times a day experimenting with how it feels when i'm on and off. also, seeing how the third dose of the day affects my sleep. my pyschiatrist wants me to report back what i find. today i've taken an off day, and certainly don't feel like i have the clarity of thought that i do when i'm taking adderall. i also feel super unmotivated despite forcing myself to work on productive things. slowly... and then now i'm here on reddit. anyway, i just had a mild fight during a conversation and when it got more and more negative my mind just shuts down. completely. blank. everything is black/grey in my mind if i could assign a color to it. it's like i'm reaching for responses, and they are in a cloud of uncondensed thoughts. they fail to crystallize. it would be better for me to keep talking through these moments. lately, i've been forcing myself to continue in these moments nonetheless than stopping in the middle of a conversation. i'm often successful in being able to articulate something, but the trade off is what i do say in these moments isn't usually helpful, elegant, or able to turn things around in a conversation that goes badly. it also need not be hard conversations. it's pretty much any communication that requires attention/concentration above the baseline of normal, fun, excited, or relaxed conversation. if something is very technical, and i'm not an expert on it already or that familiar with it, i also struggle. if i'm trying to do anything at all out of my comfort zone, i also struggle to articulate elegant and fluent thoughts. my girlfriend is so good at this. she is always telling me after the fact, i could have said this, or that, or have done xyz. instead, i struggle. i put forth so much effort and have so little to show for this. conversations on the outside seems like i probably am not trying or engaging the other person. inside, i'm racking my brain to come up with anything to say. anything at all. blank. blank. and blank. and what does come out often is not natural or an appropriate response to the situation in terms of how people would normally respond. is this common with people having i-adhd? googling this i came across this: [understanding brain fog in adult concentration deficit disorder (cdd) unfortunately is not well studied, and not part of the dsm (and thus unlikely to be something my psychiatrist would even consider when diagnosing me). so i'm not sure how real it is. i relate to this parts: &gt;brain fog - you know, that feeling that you have cobwebs in your brain; where it is hard to think clearly. you feel like you are walking around in a fog and it takes you a while to process what is going on around you. you might find it difficult to concentrate, but not because you are distracted - it is more because your thoughts simply won’t come together. you might feel like you are moving inside a dream. when you are forced to concentrate, you find it exhausting. some people describe it simply as a “fuzzy” brain. regardless of if cdd is real, does anyone else here relate to what i'm describing? is this part of adhd? what helps you get past this?",adhd,0

e620784a-e562-4d31-a8f9-93227a707148,"i don’t think anxiety ever goes away. at least, for me it doesn’t. maybe there are some #blessed people out there who have figured out a magical way to defeat their anxiety once and for all. but for most of us, there’s no cure. there’s no mountain you climb, or bridge you cross, so that you can get to the other side where you’ll be free from worry and fear. it’s more about learning to deal with anxiety when it comes, and learning to treasure those beautiful moments in time where it’s temporarily absent. a life plagued by anxiety is one of racing heartbeats and fast breathing. your shoulders often feel heavy and sometimes you’re almost sure that you can see a dark cloud hanging over you. there’s a strange fear that doesn’t seem to stem from anything specific. it’s just fear. it’s just there. sometimes you can’t enjoy a nice, peaceful train ride. or a trip to the movies with your friends. because the minute you sit down, you’re forced to be with your own thoughts. they start running around in all different directions. you’re thinking of possible dangerous scenarios, or things that have caused you anxiety in the past. or you just feel scared for no reason at all. it just happens, and you wish it wouldn’t. it’s worse in the winter. so much worse. the days are short and the weather is cold. it seems like it’s always dark. the small amount of sunlight we experience during the day doesn’t even feel like sunlight. it just feels like a strange and brief phase of the day that will be over quickly. darkness will descend in no time. this is when it’s the hardest. when everyone feels cold and bitter and cranky and cooped up. we can’t distract ourselves with light breezes and bright colors. we can’t walk around outside for hours and free ourselves from our own heads. it’s winter. everything is dead and gray and muted and cold. this is when your state of mind and your way of thinking can either make you or break you. you have to acknowledge that you probably will not defeat anxiety. you don’t need to focus all of your energy on “fixing yourself” or finding a cure. stop making yourself feel like there’s something wrong with you. stop making yourself feel ashamed of your anxiety. stop being frustrated with yourself. just because you can’t beat anxiety doesn’t mean you’re letting it win. yes, you’re probably going to have to deal with it for the rest of your life. not all the time, of course. sometimes you will have incredibly wonderful periods of time where you don’t have any anxiety. you can go days without it. you can go months without it. sometimes you will go years before you have to deal with it again. but often, regardless of how long it’s been, anxiety will find its way back to you. you do not have control over the cure, but the beautiful part is that you do have control over how you handle it. the most important thing you have to work on is your state of mind. when anxiety starts to take over, it’s tempting to give in to your thoughts. to let yourself crumble under the fear and the worry and the terror. what you have to remember is that you’re not alone. you are not by yourself. you may feel like you are the only person in the world to ever feel like a prisoner inside their own mind, but you are not. there are so many others who have been where you’ve been, but they eventually got free. not free from anxiety, necessarily, but free from the dark way of thinking that anxiety can cause. a lot of people struggle from anxiety. not everyone, but enough people to show you that there are others who have gotten through this, just like you will. you’re struggling now. you’re terrified now. you feel alone now. you’re telling yourself it will be okay. you’re telling yourself you will get through this. you’re telling yourself you will be stronger when you come out on the other side. but you have a hard time believing it. that’s okay. as long as you’re trying to believe it, as long as you are wanting to believe it, those thoughts will carry you through the darker moments. and eventually, they will start to make sense. they will start to seem possibly true. a lot of people will give you a lot of different advice on how to deal with anxiety. some of it will work for you, and some of it won’t. some of the things that do work for you will not work for your friend or your coworker. everyone is different. everyone’s mind is different. so everyone will deal with anxiety a different way. here’s what you need to remember: there’s a lot of advice floating out there about dealing with anxiety because so many people have had to deal with it. so when you’re feeling ashamed or frustrated or exhausted or embarrassed about your anxiety, just remind yourself that you are normal. you are not a freak. you are not the only person in the world that has ever been this terrified. a lot of us are fighting it. a lot of us are scared. a lot of us have had bad nights that we didn’t think were ever going to end, just like you have. you are human. which means you will get through it, just like so many other people have. you will not defeat it forever. but you will learn how to be okay – and more importantly, how to be happy – in spite of it.",anxiety,1

below is what worked for me. the first step was to realise why i had health anxiety. that was easy, i was probably anxious about my health because i lost a very close relative when i was 11. the second step was to identify when my health anxiety episodes were taken place. checking my records of doctor visits, i could see that my health anxiety manifests after a stressful period in my personal or working life. the stressful period would cause some psychosomatic symptoms and would trigger my health anxiety. another trigger would be something i heard about someone dying or getting sick or reading about a rare illness. i was also feeling more anxious in the evenings, weekends or holidays as then i would have more time to be obsessed with my undiagnosed illness that affected 1 in a billion. the first two steps set the ground for my recovery as it made me look in myself and helped me identify what strategies worked best. the third step in my recovery was to realise that there is nothing special about health anxiety. my view is that health anxiety as well as every type of anxiety are the same: excessive adrenaline that causes irrational thinking and psychosomatic symptoms. all these anxiety symptoms can be explained easily, but as they are so many, i would rather not cover them all to keep it as short as possible, as our anxious minds are impatient too :). this was such a relief for me as i would not have to deal with all these different anxiety labels, but i would just focus on just resolving my anxiety. a definition of anxiety that really helped me when i had anxious thoughts was that “anxiety causes you to give a much higher probability of something bad happening.” this could be a rare disease or catching the deadly germ from not washing your hands every 5 minutes. this helped me identify what my recovered self would be like: when i had an irrationally anxious thought about something bad happening, i would think that the probability of this happening is extremely low and then i would simply not care as most people in this earth. easier said that done, i know. but i got to this state eventually after a lot of trial and error, practice and patience. this is what worked for me: - a hugely eye opener resource for me is the following link that i cannot recommend enough: i read this several times as it is huge and it is difficult to grasp at first. i think it is better than every other anxiety book i have ever read. i followed most of the recommendations and show great results quickly. - i also made an invisible contract with myself that i will stop googling for diseases, stop asking for reassurance (as the excellent pinned post indicates) and stop caring about my symptoms. every time i had a symptom or an anxious thought, i would do nothing about it. nothing at all and would get on with my life. if most people would not care about a silly thought that does not mean anything, why should i care? thoughts are just thoughts, they do not represent reality, so who cares? guess what! the more i did that, the less anxious thoughts and symptoms i had. - i would keep myself busy doing things not matter how i felt. i would read books, watch movies, doing all the tasks in my job while ignoring my feelings. i would pretend that i do not care no matter how i felt. i would fake it till i make it. the more i did that, the more i was telling to my mind that i do not care and the less my anxiety was over time. - i would be patient and would not expect to recover overnight. i had many setbacks that my anxious thoughts came back. i am prepared to have a setback anytime, but i do not care. as i see them, setbacks are an excellent opportunity to practice my strategies. the more i practiced my strategies, the less setbacks i had. the last one was 1 and a half years ago and lasted for a day. - finally, two proven strategies that have worked since the beginning of time is exercise and meditation. especially with exercise i started seeing benefits right away. meditation made me better realise when a worrying thought was rational or irrational. i fully understand that the above are not simple. yes, it took me time and practice. in the beginning, i believed that i would never recover. but once i started seeing benefits, i committed myself. and here i am today, a typical person enjoying his life, his time with family and friends and his hobbies. so this is my personal story and this is what worked for me. as i said this is not medical or professional advice, it is just my experience. but through my research oo anxiety, i believe that anybody can recover. feel free to ask any questions and sorry again for my english.",anxiety,1

49b2ebd0-a38f-4494-bbbd-60bb9e5bcc2c,"i know this is long and i don't know if a lot of people will read this but i really just want to help. i had 2 panic attacks over the end of february and first day of march. i went to the doctor and had my blood work done, ekg, everything and they said i'm perfectly healthy. i workout 6 times a week. i had nothing to panic about! after that day, i started developing harm ocd/intrusive thoughts about the recent news events that's been going on. it made me miserable, hopeless, and sometimes i would feel like ""what's the point?"" i wasn't depressed but i felt derealization. and then i went on to do cbt on my own, went to a therapist, and i realized i felt better but i would still get anxiety attacks. my anxiety kept jumping off to something else after solving one problem. so i kept searching for a cure which led me to learn more about diet, magnesium, and vitamins. magnesium - 70% of americans are magnesium deficient and i deprived myself even more when i was trying to lose weight. i started taking magnesium (magnesium citrate is better, i just started those yesterday) and it made me stop stressing about unnecessary things and obsessing about negative thoughts! i slept better at night and my body stopped twitching a lot. i stopped getting anxiety attacks throughout the day and would only get them maybe 30 mins each day now but i'd move on. i suggest taking 250 mg a day. check the magnesium deficiency symptoms cause this may solve your problems. diet - your body needs a minimum amount of carbs, fats, and protein to function. all this plays a role in your mood. these macronutrients are also important in developing serotonin and transferring them to your brain. serotonin can be developed naturally, as long as you track your diet. i suggest myfitness pal app. track the amount of grams of protein, carbs, and fat that you are taking daily. at least meet the minimum. your brain needs this to function properly! vitamins - so many of us are deprived of important vitamins. take multivitamins and fish oil. the fish oil with omega 3 have helped reduce my irritation and i feel less mood swings! there have been less instances where i felt derealization and not motivated. i started taking all these supplements and tracking my diet sunday and i haven't felt it since! i used to feel it every day. i still get anxiety attacks here and there but it's gone down to like 10%. it was at 60% a week ago. and i heard from people that it never came back even years after as long as they made sure they ate healthy, exercised, and made sure to take time off from stress. it also takes your body a long time to get your deficiencies back up to normal level and will most likely take around 3 months. so be patient. for people who has had anxiety or depression their whole life, it may be that your body just isn't as efficient when it comes to absorbing these nutrients. i know this isn't the cure for everybody but i hope this can help others. there's ton of videos and articles about this online. friends who had anxiety were real life examples for me as they got out of it. i just don't want anyone to go through anxiety, it sucks and feels like hell. if i can help even 1 person feel better, it'd make me really happy. doctors don't even ask us about our diet. neither do most therapists. that's because they don't know about nutrition. they don't study wellness. this was an explanation by a doctor from ucla (forgot his name) as to why we never got blood work done in out nutrients. doctors study medicine so that's what they prescribe. cbt helped a lot for me and i think it has to be a mix of all therapy, exercise, healthy diet, and remembering to take time off stress that can help you manage anxiety. man this is long af lol, shoutout if you read this whole thing.",anxiety,1

c14664d7-5468-4930-afec-992b8c7de203,"i always make so many negative posts about my anxiety and depression but aside from that all, i do have a success story. i was a shy kid growing up, my parents often let me get away with avoiding things i didn't like. in my teens i decided school was too stressful and i started taking days off, before long it became a fear to go. my parents eventually home schooled me and i lost any friends i had made. suddenly i was stuck in the house too afraid to leave, i was pale and unhappy and my only social interactions were online forums and world of warcraft. at 18 i applied for university, absolutely traumatic! i went in and then left as soon as class was over and went home to hide away in bed. just before i graduated university, my father died in front of me. i completely isolated myself after this, uni was over and i had no reason to leave the house anymore. i would spend weeks laying in bed, i couldn't even leave the house to attend his funeral. i was a mess. i left the house just to go to the doctors for anti depressants and anxiety medication but even that was a traumatic experience and i would get taxis everywhere to avoid buses. one year later and i just couldn't live like this. my birthday was spent alone in my room surfing the net. my online forum friends said happy birthday and i had a card from my mother but that was it. it didn't matter how many cards or wishes i had, it was the fact that this was me. alone. (i forgot to mention that from the ages of 13-22, all the time i spent at home, i was using to teach myself to become a digital artist. and i got good in my late teens . i was able to sell stuff from home to keep me going financially.) at 22 i saw a job position. it was a digital artist in a company abroad, this meant a 3 hour plane flight. keep in mind i had never been on a plane before. i applied out of sheer frustration one night thinking i'd never hear back and then stayed up all night playing wow and went to bed at 6am as usual. when i woke up that afternoon i had an email from the company... they wanted to interview me on skype and then if that went well they would fly me over to have a face to face interview. well, i panicked. this was a way out but it was also way out of my comfort zone. even the skype interview was something that kept me awake all night. long story short, i ended up getting flown all the way to them. getting on a plane the first time alone was awful, i was sat next to an old couple and i told them i was scared out of desperation looking for any comfort. i remember ordering sick bags on amazon because i thought i would be sick. i even tried to convince myself the plane would crash and that i should just not go. but i went. and i got the job. i've been there a few years now and i got a boyfriend, people i consider friends (but no close friends), and a nice apartment all from doing something i love. i'm still very depressed and anxious in social situations and people do think i'm weird sometimes because i come across as nervous but my god, if someone like me can make such a big move in life - anyone can. i was an absolute disaster. and my past still haunts me (as mentioned in other posts, not having fun memories of my teens or anything to show for it). tl;dr i was a depressed anxious hermit mess and i applied for a job abroad and got it and now i'm still a depressed mess, but i'm doing a lot better. anyone have similar experience?",anxiety,1

eadd8326-71c0-4536-9114-c532cafdfa26,"for the past 5 years i've been working very hard on my anxiety... i used to be so bad that just about everything would cause anxiety, but now, i barely have any.... i've written down a short list of things that i've learnt in the hopes they would help others. i welcome any feedback and additions to the list!the first step to getting in control of your anxiety, is to fully accept that you can make a massive difference. if you don’t accept this, you’ll be telling yourself things like “this will never work” or “it’s just who i am”. if you believe those things, you won’t make progress. you have to own the anxiety first. it’s yours and yours alone, and that means it’s also yours to discard. you have to get our of your own way… you are the only obstacle stopping yourself from being a better person.anxiety is not a personality trail like shyness or introversion. that’s what i used to think. i thought that because i was sensitive, it meant that i was also anxious…. they are connected, because it’s the sensitivity that made me create strong coping mechanisms in the first place, but they are not a package; one triggers the other.anxiety is all about strong routines. strong paths and habits that your brain follows. thoughts are easily triggered - hyper sensitive, and thoughts trigger the chemicals that make you feel so terrible. the smallest shot of adrenaline can make you think, oh fuck, here we go, i’m going to feel sooo stupid in front of my work colleagues and pretty soon your own body is full of negative and terrible chemicals until you can’t think straight anymore. sound familiar? 😊 the trick is to keep working on your thoughts. at first nothing will change, but as you slowly build new routines by repetition, you will begin to create new paths and new triggers, and more and more and more the anxiety will go away.here are the discoveries and tricks that have changed my life: 1. here is am important bio-hack…. the anxiety we feel was probably laid down as a child due to strong emotions. when you are young, even small things can be interpreted as big things. strong emotion etches strong grooves in our brain. those grooves can be smoothed over with repetition, and if you have strong feelings and passion about wanting to change yourself for the better, this will help to make new grooves also. strong emotion leads to faster changes. 2. next, you need to talk away the layers of self hate that distract you from working on yourself productively. understand that you are anxious for very good reason, and that anxiety used to help you stay safe. accept and love that part of yourself as it did it’s job well, and now it’s time to move on. in fact, flip your emotion on it’s head - say to yourself “you’re awesome for being anxious right now, you sure did a great job saving me in the past”. don’t allow hate towards yourself. break the pattern. 3. choose your language carefully. there is a big difference between saying to yourself “i’m anxious about seeing my friends tomorrow” and “i’m curious to see my friends tomorrow”. you have the choice to choose the words that you use, and the words you use will change how you think. **what you think is how you experience life.** at first a little voice in your head might say “whatever, i just changed my sentence into something i don’t believe”…. but keep doing it and soon you start to see it work. analyse everything you say and think. if it’s negative, especially when it’s negative without any good reason, discard that word, and use a different one its place. get your family and close friends involved too - they are probably really tired of words you use to describe yourself or situations and can help you choose different ones. 4. stay in the moment. always ask yourself “is what i’m anxious about actually happening right now?”. if it isn’t, accept that it’s possible but don’t dwell on it. tell yourself you will deal with it if it happens and move on to a new thought. realise that “preparing” for almost anything negative is pointless.. it just makes you expect the worst. bad things happen rarely, so if you are going to prepare yourself for something, choose to think about how great it will be. remember, everything is a choice, and even highly anxious people don’t choose to think about how much they are going to hate dessert when it comes out after dinner. 5. involve those that are close to you and that you trust: tell them what you are doing and get them to keep you on track. also get them to celebrate with you. when we make changes, they feel slow and often insignificant to us, but they can actually be massive over time. get your friends to help remind you of just how much you have grown and changed. it helps to hear it from them and it helps to keep you going. 6. practice mindfulness.... in it’s essence, this is practicing acknowledging a thought, and then letting it go. it sounds silly, but sometimes it’s better not to try and ignore something. the more you try not to think about pink elephants, the more you do... so rather than actively trying to reject negative and anxious thoughts, acknowledge them “i recognise that i am thinking that my whole day is ruined because i spilled my coffee”, and then allow them to have no further energy in your life. just let them go. no more stories, no fall-out effect. once you have done that a lot, you’ll then be able to correct yourself. the previous statement might turn to “but i also recognise that spilling my coffee is something i can easily deal with and it doesn’t mean anything”. 7. understand that nothing has meaning other than the meaning that we assign to it. what people do, what happens to you, what responses you have, don’t have any meaning - they are just facts, until you assign a meaning to them. so rather assign negative meanings to things, replace them with neutral or positive meanings. 8. understand the chemical processes that sit behind anxiety. we feel so terrible because of the chemicals in our body. when we first get that jolt of energy, it’s just there to get us to pay attention. if we keep telling ourselves stories of how bad things could be, more and more and more chemicals are released to the point where we can’t even cope anymore. that’s what a panic attack is. what people often don’t know is that all this is natural.... the chemicals are there to tell us if there is something unresolved that we need to pay attention to. so how do you stop it? you stop it by making a decision. it’s that easy! you could decide that you will worry about that later. that often helps to deescalate right away. you could decide that there is nothing wrong at the moment, so i you won’t give it any more energy. you could decide that nothing will happen badly. the key is making a firm decision. once you make it, the chemicals will slowly start to leave your body. once you get good at it, you’ll feel normal again in minutes. 9. ask yourself better questions: don’t ask yourself “why is my day so terrible”. ask yourself “how can i make my day better”. don’t ask yourself: “why is my friend not calling me”. ask yourself “what can i do for my friend that will make her feel great”. don’t ask yourself “why am i so anxious”. ask yourself “what can i do right now to help me be less anxious”. you see, the questions you ask determine the answers your brain searches for. if you ask questions to which there is no positive answer, all you will get is negative answers... they don’t help. they just feed the anxiety. when you ask questions that you can only get positive answers from, you will get positive answers. 10. take massive action: when you are in a place where you are feeling like you are ready to do something about your anxiety or take the next step, don’t just think about it, take massive action, right then. don’t just write something down, buy a book, start listening to a podcast, book yourself in for counselling, tell your friends about your plans. our brains convince us out of anything uncomfortable in a matter of seconds… we are programmed to avoid any discomfort… the best think you can do is cease the opportunity and start making change. 11. ask yourself what anxiety does for you that is helpful.... what do you get our of anxiety? you might get sympathy, attention, feel loved, get days off, feel special etc.. make sure that the things you get from anxiety are replaced. ideally, if you get attention when you feel anxious or depressed, convince the people you care about to reduce their attention during those times, but massively increase how much they praise you when you do something positive that is challenging your anxiety. 12. push yourself just a little bit every day. you don’t have to live in constant agony, you just have to make a little progress every day… tiny bits of progress add up to massive progress over weeks, months and years. don’t focus on how big the changes are, focus on what your next step is. everything above is easy to get started with. it doesn’t need to be perfect.",anxiety,1

d7c28b8b-69e9-4372-908a-f2421ee9db5d,"i never know where to start. i’ve been suspecting that there was more to my mental illness than just depression and anxiety for about a year now. it’s amazing how hard it is to find a psychiatrist that is accepting new patients and your specific insurance plan. i must have called fifty doctors a hundred times over six months to even get an appointment to begin with. for years now, i’ve known that certain types of drugs will trigger a manic episode with me. when i was 18, before i dropped out of college, i took 30mgs of xr adderall for finals weeks. i spent most of that -night writing a three-page poem about society, life, disappoints, and (of course) adderall. i then spent most of that next day convinced that i singlehandedly discovered the astronomical principles that led to the creation of the universe and the reason behind the big bang. …but that was just the drugs, right? looking back, i now realize that there are countless other sober examples of bipolar behavior. the incredibly reckless sexual behavior. the inexplicable mood swings. the arguments with my wife. the terrible reaction i’ve had to just taking antidepressants. the unwarranted notions that i might be a genius. that’s just to name a few. but that’s not the part that bothers me. i was diagnosed as bipolar 1 with primarily mixed episodes due to my severe depression and anxiety. the label itself is palatable enough, too. i mean, goddamn, it makes a lot of fucking sense. the part that gets me are all the things in between. all the things that i am proud of, and all the things that i like about myself. when i am not depressed i am considered a very smart, charming, and articulate person. all of the spontaneous gestures that make my wife love me so much. hell, i have written an entire screenplay and i’m singlehandedly raising enough money to actually film it by next year. how much of that i me? how much is my disease? what is the difference between those two concepts? i am not ashamed of my diagnosis. i am not ashamed of going back on medication. as far as i can tell, the abilify is having mostly positive side effects, and the prozac has yet to kick in. the part that fucks with me is my newfound inability to trust my “good” days. when i just thought i was depressed it was easy. i had a clear litmus test of whether i was in, or out of, control. *am i depressed? yes or no? okay, now i know how my day will be principally governed.* bipolar isn’t that simple. i can’t trust my moments of happiness. i have to face every new wave of excitement and hyperfocus with a sense of caution and skepticism. i look back on my past accomplishments and wonder how much of that was actually me. when i’m having a pleasant day (i.e., feeling “normal”) and i’m talking and laughing with my wife, friends, or coworkers, i now catch myself thinking: *oh god, it’s happening again. what am i about do to or say that i’ll regret when i come crashing down in a few days or weeks?* i feel like when those thoughts are left on repeat long enough, they eventually ruminate into something a lot more severe: how am i possibly going to get more than three hours of sleep tonight or the night after that? what if i really am a genius and also what if this movie i’m going to make finally pushes me into the limelight i sometimes crave so desperately? even this fucking write-up is only happening because i’m manic right now. how will i ever learn to trust myself? how can i ever appreciate the best parts about myself when they are also the parts that make me so sick? how do you fucking deal with this?",bipolar,2

(after cycles of dieting, losing weight, then binge eating) i was on a couple diets after high school but i wasn’t as obsessed with my weight after i graduated. i was put on olanzapine last year and i gained 12kg in three months. i was shocked when i weighed myself after three months and decided that i needed to go on a diet. but i couldn’t stop the cravings, and i started making myself throw up in the beginning of this year. i’d binge eat, throw up and starve for a couple days. (although it was not all the time) now, even when i don’t try to throw up, i just feel sick every time i get full, and sometimes have to make myself throw up just to get rid of the nausea. i stopped olanzapine about a week and a half ago because now i think i might be developing an eating disorder. did anyone have a similar experience with antipsychotics? i have an appointment with my pdoc next week who’ll probably prescribe me a different antipsychotic, should i tell him about this? i’d rather lose weight, honestly, than having delusions and paranoia.",bipolar,2

52ce9e98-205d-4e5c-af10-bdeed74cee99,"sharing medical advice is bad for a number of reasons. even if a doctor, pharmacist, etc told you something that information may be specific to your case and not applicable to the op. the op may have other factors that complicate the situation which you may not even know about. recently someone posted that her husband, a pharmacy tech, said that a certain dose of ativan is safe. she didn't realize (or care?) that 1) pharmacy techs are not prescribers 2) the person she was talking to had a serious substance abuse disorder. i'm sure that dose *is* safe for some people, i've personally taken higher doses of similar drugs. but i had withdrawal, and it was shitty, and my own risk benefit analysis was different. everyone's risk benefit analysis is different, which is why they should only alter their dosing with help from their own doctor. not an internet doctor who hasn't examined them. when you give your advice, including recommending a dose, you are making it less likely that someone will consult their doctor and you are actively doing harm. consulting your doctor by telephone takes minutes and should be done whenever you have an urgent medical question that can't wait until your next appointment.if it's too urgent to wait for the doctor to call you back, you should go to urgent care or call 911. there is never a situation where asking reddit for medical care is appropriate. i do not know how to stem the tide of medical ""advice"" that is coming through this forum, but it needs to stop. i am contemplating making it a ban-on-sight offense for particularly damaging incidences. the only thing it is okay to say to a poster asking for medical advice is ""please consult your doctor/pharmacist/poison control/urgent care/hospital"" that's it. that's all you are qualified to say. this ties into our rule against alternative treatment, which at this time includes cannabis. the rule has *always* allowed for discussion of personal history though, so it's okay to say ""i vape before bed and i think it helps me sleep,"" just not ""you should vape before bed if you have trouble sleeping."" similarly, ""i take 2mg ativan when i'm angry"" is perfectly fine, but ""it's safe for you to take up to 2mg of ativan when you are angry"" is medical advice and is prohibited. we treat otc and rx substances differently. if you have scientific evidence in the form of a peer reviewed published study indicating that a certain otc (for our purposes this includes cannabis and behavioral modifications) substance may help with bipolar disorder please post it along with a link to the study! these substances are ones that an individual can, according to the government, probably take or learn about without medical direction, that's why they are otc. of course you should always ask your doctor for advice about any otc substances you take that might interact with your medication. you can't do this with prescribed substances. we know they help, but they can't be taken safely without a doctor's dosage guidelines and supervision. even telling someone to decrease their dose or how to taper their meds is not permitted. taper information is all over the web, for those truly in need. you know who else can help? their doctor. who they need to call if they are running out of meds. this comes up a lot, but you cannot help. please use this space to discuss these rules and how you'd like to see them enforced.",bipolar,2

[latuda copay 3. check if you have a preauthorization requirement for this drug. unfortunately this might require you to call your insurance company directly. some pharmacies might be able to tell you if its required. for me if my pdoc didnt submit a preauthorization the cost for me was near retail which is about $1300/us. 4. check if you have a prescription deductible. i did and at the beginning of every year it renews. so i was surprised to find that my drug i was getting for $150 was now ringing up at $400. sadly the only way past this is to pay it. but once paid, my cost was back down. 5. mckesson the company that provides the discount card will also provide you with two 14day supplies of latuda at no cost. that is right, **free**. just today i got my second free 14day supply of latuda. call them up at 1-855-5-latuda and you can speak to a rep to get this. they will provide you with the info that is used the same as another discount card. 6. lastly i was told of another option they have available where they will supposedly try to negotiate a lower cost with the insurance company. i'm not sure what kind of success rate there is with this as i have not yet attempted to go this route. this will be my last ditch effort before telling doc its too much and have to find something else. in order to do this you would call the same number above 1-855-5-latuda and inquire talk to someone about what options are available and perhaps inquire specifically about negotiating how much the insurance cost/pay. i only found out about this one as my insurance is always rejected with the card so i called the card company to sort it out and was somehow transferred to a rep that informed me this is what her department did, before transferring me to another. anwyays, hope this helps some of you. the preauthorization and deductible points should apply to all medications and is something to consider. its possible that the other solutions might work with other medications as well if they are cost prohibitive. edit: looks like the patent does expire on july 2 2018. so perhaps there is hope for a generic sooner than later.",bipolar,2

ca9c1424-5454-4824-9120-ce7ebabc356f,"i often go around saying it to people, but i recently let it convince me of something that simply wasn't true. and because i believed it, i convinced myself someone who matters to me was really upset with me when they weren't. and because the anger i perceived seems like it was unjustified, i got bitter and acted like an ass. and that wasn't okay. for all the progress i've made, for all my insight, i still have a great deal of foolishness. and perhaps some toolishness to match =p. but i digress. some recent life events have left me feeling really insecure and lacking, and i let those feelings convince me of something that just wasn't true. i saw the slightest suggestion they might've been right, forgetting all the evidence that wasn't in the immediate past, and let my feelings go down a dark path that kind of convinced me i was worthless. and i want to say i'm better than that. i wish i'm better than that; i hope i am. but it can still happen. anyway, i heard back from that friend and realized i'd let it happen and felt like an ass. so i did some introspection after that; i asked myself how i let it happen and how to keep it from happening again. as you've probably noticed by now, i try to make my posts useful to more than just myself; i want other people to be able to benefit and make progress--the rare exceptions typically being when i feel absolutely horrible and need to vent/need support and to give brief updates after making that kind of post. #and i realized something: a few things actually... * the reality testing i use to address psychosis to counter beliefs that seem insane could've helped me prevent these runaway emotions. reality testing, for those of you who don't know, often focuses on taking things from the real world you know to be true (in this case, conversations i know were sincere) and seeing if they're compatible with beliefs that you want to question. sometimes, as the absurdity and disconnectedness of psychosis can require, it means making choices to find evidence. generally speaking, when you do that, it's best to opt for choices that can find you proof but don't result in painful consequences in either version of reality. so far, i've found that the evidence has always supported conventional reality in the long run, so i'd like to encourage you to favor less painful consequences in that reality option. if i'd realized reality testing can address more than just psychosis, but also hyperbolic thinking, i might've avoided engaging in hurtful behavior. * i indulged a couple cognitive distortions / logical fallacies in concluding my friend was upset with me, and by identifying them now maybe i can prevent them in the future. lists of cognitive distortions that you can use to identify your own flawed thinking can be found and i let the recency effect (you more strongly remember things that have happened in the recent past than the distant past) enable emotional reasoning (something that can be hard to remind ourselves (and my dad has a terribly hard time with this sometimes) is that what you're feeling doesn't necessarily reflect the way things actually are. last night i was talking to a friend i was surprised to learn is a trump supporter, and i realized the extent to which i'd let the media demonize my view of him went further than i'd recognized--i'm not saying he's a saint, but i'm thinking he's much less of a nazi than i've made him out to be). * in rebt we talked about ""crushing ants."" ant stands for automatic negative thoughts. in the past i'd been really good at monitoring my thoughts and identifying irrational thinking like this, but since i no longer believe the people around me or the people i think of can hear my thoughts, i've focused more on motivating myself to develop as an adult and working towards a healthier relationship with mind-altering substances. this can be pretty difficult actually, and since i wasn't letting myself see that ***depression was lying to me*** and recognizing my cognitive distortions, i wasn't practicing what i'd learned by dismissing them as dangerous and without merit. sometimes the best way to address these thought patterns has been to come at them head on and challenge them (sometimes with reality testing!), and sometimes it's best to dismiss them and focus on something else. when you let them run unchecked, bad shit can happen like convincing yourself you're worthless. #the takeaway? **depression lies. i encourage you to use the comments to identify an insecurity or a negative thought train you sometimes let win out and address it with some of the skills here. or to share something you've been letting your negative self thoughts convince you of that you don't know how to disprove, so we as a community can address it with you and help you fight it off for the future.** ps: sorry for the extra-long post, i feel like i kind of needed to make it long to get all my thoughts out and to work through what's been challenging lately. i'm planning on x-posting this to /r/bipolar, since i know that while there's a solid amount of users who frequent both subs, there are also a solid chunk of users who primarily or only frequent one of the two.",bipolar,2

c0ca3887-ec8c-4882-b253-496e0d49424e,"i wish people would understand that depression isn't always crying in the shower and playing sad songs in bed. sometimes it's not wanting to talk to anyone for days and other times it's desperately needing to be around people. sometimes it's having no appetite even though you haven't eaten anything since yesterday and sometimes it's eating everything you have in the fridge. depression isn't your boyfriend/girlfriend holding you and telling you that everything is going to be okay. it's sitting across the table, not eating, having them ask you what's wrong and knowing that you're ruining their night because you can't seem to snap out of it and just be happy. it's the frustrating feeling of desperately wanting to enjoy something and just fucking be normal for once. it's keeping things a secret from the people you love because you don't want them to look at you differently. no, depression isn't beautiful black and white images. depression is lonely and frustrating and mostly just fucking exhausting",depression,3

b47f551f-b75b-4463-b609-21bf453df174,"this is a long story but i'm going to be as honest as possible for the first time in my life. that's the advantage of using a throwaway account. the reason i'm using it is because i deleted my real account. in fact, i deleted every other account on every website i have here on the internet, except for skype, because so many of my friends are on there, and yet, i think i will delete that too. let's go back to the beginning. i have always suffered. from the beginning of my life i have suffered, all the way up until the present moment. i have always suffered and the suffering has never stopped. don't get wrong, there have been moments of joy as well, and there have been real connections that i have felt with people in my life that have made it worth it, but the suffering has always haunted me. it has always followed me. it's always there, even when it doesn't feel like it, even when i forget about it. it's always there waiting for the opportunity to consume me. i have always suffered and i will never stop suffering. i have tried to do good things. people always told me that i was a talented musician and a writer, and so i made a couple of short albums, and i tried to write a novel, but nobody cared. nobody was interested. maybe the people who told me i had talent were just flattering me. i don't know. i did believe that i had talent but i don't believe that anymore. i pursued these things because i believed that it was the one thing i could make a meaningful difference in the world, and that by affecting people with the work that i did i could really make a difference, but i truly don't have any talent, and my work is terrible, and it doesn't affect anybody, and nobody cares. there have been periods in my life when i have been a horrible person. i have been disgusting to the people around me and it haunts me all the time. there have been times where i have become so solipsistic and cynical that i have treated people like garbage because i didn't think that it matted. maybe i wanted them to feel as bad as i did or maybe i just genuinely did not care about how they felt at all. but it haunts me now. i think about it every day and i hate myself for it. i wish i had never done those things to those people but i can never take that back. it will always be a part of me. it will always be what people think of when they think of me. they will always think of the horrible things i did to them. i can never change that. it will follow me for the rest of my life. i have tried to be a good person. the times that i have been happiest in my life is when i have honestly believed that other people were good and deserving of help and empathy and i have acted on those beliefs, but it's hard to sustain that for any length of time, and in a weird way, it's so much easier to retreat into my protective shell of sarcasm and cynicism where i can't be hurt by others because i can never empathize and therefore i never feel other people's pain, especially in the dog-eat-dog world of adulthood, i have very consciously acted in a clinical, unemotional way, and i hate myself for it. i wish i could be real and emotionally honest but i am so sensitive to any kind of emotional stimuli and it destroys me to feel the pain and sadness that i see all around me. if i let people get under my skin, i become very distraught very quickly. i hate that i became that cold person that i was. i hate that in the past, i have thought in such calculating, cynical, logical terms, manipulating others for my own benefit instead of truly caring about them and giving them the compassion and help that they deserved for being just like me, suffering too just as everybody does. something amazing happened to me recently. it was the most amazing thing that had ever happened in my life. i met a girl on the internet who is truly the most beautiful person i have ever encountered in every single way, which sounds like hyperbole or infatuation, and in some respects it is, but it's also genuinely true. a part of me had always fantasized that somebody like that would be out there, but i never thought it would be possible in real life, considering how impossible the harsh realities of the world make it to be the kind of person that good people genuinely want to be. it's for that reason and many others that i just never thought it would be possible. somebody couldn't that good. people couldn't possibly be that kind. nobody could possibly try so hard. life just didn't allow for things like that. it didn't make sense. it didn't seem possible. the best i could hope for, i thought, was that maybe i would find someone like that in a film, book or television show, but sadly, despite looking very hard, i had no luck. some sick part of me still must have hoped, despite everything, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that such a person could exist, because why else would i have been writing these songs and these stories about all this time and trying to make myself in the person that this imaginary girl would like? what was it that kept me holding on aside from the fear that there was nothing on the other side? if they gave euthanasia to depressives, i would have already accepted it a million times over, and yet i have continued because i am afraid to jump or hang myself or take pills or whatever you're supposed to do, and i have continued to suffer, at least until very recently, until this month that has just gone by when i met this beautiful person and for the first time in my life, i felt genuinely normal and confident. after talking to her and experience what i called her ""glow,"" i could go out and socialize like normal people do, and i could make friends easily, and i could effortlessly sustain faith in my ability to sustain normal adult relationships, despite the lack of available proof from the past. i must say, i have made more friends in the past month and a half than i have in the entire rest of my life up until that point. this girl has inspired my art as well. i have written songs about her and some of the lines i have written have been so good that i have been genuinely tricked into thinking that maybe there is some modicum of talent in me after all, but of course, the real reason is her, herself a talented writer, and the moment she goes away, i won't have that any more. when i am around her i feel like an amazing, extraordinary person who is capable of anything, and the extraordinary thing is that when i put it to the test, it's actually true, i really can do just about anything. i have always wanted to be a performer for instance, and so i went and joined a local theater group, something my anxiety, depression, self-loathing and cynicism would have never allowed me to do before, and yet, thinking of this girl, as i do all the time, even when i sleep, even in my dreams, i was entirely confident i could do it, and it happened without effort. in fact, the people there seem to like me an extraordinary amount, perhaps because they appreciate the positive energy that i have gained from this amazing thing that has happened to me. similarly, i have depended heavily on drugs and alcohol in the past to help me manage my emotions, to keep those horrible feelings at bay, but when i have been with this girl, i have felt absolutely no inclination to use those chemicals, because i want to do nothing to alter the ""glow"" in any way, to change the quality of it. the way that i feel in the days after we spend talking on skype is better than any drug i've been on. it's better than anything i could name. it struck me from the very first time that it made me feel normal like nothing else ever has, and it does, but at the same time, it's really scaring me, because i start to think of what would happen if she left me, which i know is only a matter of time because it's always been clear that i like her far more than she likes me. the day has always been lurking around the corner when she becomes bored of me and decides that she wants to call it off. in fact, that wouldn't be so bad compared to what would happen if she simply drifted away, gradually but eventually entirely. how can i deal with that? how is that something i can be expected to live with? in a way, it wasn't so bad the way things used to be before she came along, because i wasn't even aware that things *could* be better, that it was possible for me to feel relatively normal, happy and confident, and to effortlessly achieve things that i have always dreamed of doing, to live a sober lifestyle, to make new friends, to go after my dreams and hobbies without embarrassment, to talk to other people without a sense of perpetual shame and fear, to genuinely want to be kind and helpful to others, etc. etc. i have been thinking about this a lot, the fact this day will inevitably come, and i cry and cry, something which i hadn't done for years, not even when my life has hit rock bottom, because, in the words of dylan, ""when you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose."" the first month of our relationship will likely always be the best period of my life, but then something happened which i dealt with incredibly poorly and it fucked everything up. i got a message from her saying that there had been an incident and she would kind of remote and unresponsive for a few days. if it had actually only been a few days, that would have been okay. she wouldn't tell me what it was at first, which upset me so much, because i cared very deeply about her and i wanted so much to help and to understand what was going on, but she wouldn't let me in. i would message her on twitter and the fact that i was constantly bugging her about it made me feel like a complete creep, like the person i used to be, like the person who never in a million years could have imagined being anywhere near a girl like her, instead relegated to the shadows, away from everybody so that i wouldn't inflict my suffering on others, so i wouldn't bring them down with the toxic and cynical personality i had developed from suffering so intensely for so many years. so i cried and cried and worried for days and sought help where i could. i called mental health helplines and i stayed at my parents place and tried to tell them what was going on (although they didn't really understand). i got in touch with a doctor whom i am still corresponding, and just generally pushed myself harder than i ever had in recent memory to fill the horrible hole that was rapidly growing inside of me. i was filling it with all kinds of things, from hours of intense exercise every day (swimming, weights, running), making several new friends every day on skype/4chan/etc, talking for hours and hours and having these incredibly deep and beautiful conversations where i connected with these strangers so deeply in way that i never would have thought possible by simply being open and unafraid to be myself, a quality i had actually picked up from this girl. but i was relapsing too. i was beginning to use stimulants again to help me focus on my studies at first, because i had been doing nothing but think of this girl, and though it doesn't help me quite as much as speed or ritalin, it made a difference. i began drinking again, half a box of wine a night, because it made the feeling go away, and helped me to think about other things, and to socialize with others more easily, and to laugh instead of cry. it's like that r.e.m. song, half a world away: ""i've had too much to drink, didn't think, didn't think of you, i guess that's all i needed."" it worked at first but, as is always the case with these things, it's taking more and more to fill the whole, and so i am adding pharmaceuticals like opiates and benzos to the mix to try to make the feeling go away, and it's the same thing: wonderful at first, but now i need more, i need to fill the hole and nothing is quite enough. it's been a long time since i had the glow that i get from this girl, the one that keeps me sober, and i am turning back into my old horrible self, the one who doesn't care about anybody but myself, the one who was such a solipsist that i would do horrible things to people purely to relieve my boredom. everybody know that nietzsche quote, ""what doesn't kill you makes you stronger,"" and some people have noticed that it's not exactly true: the things that hurt you and that cause you to suffer actually make you weaker. when you are in a perpetual state of recovery and when something new always seems to happen just when you think you are starting to get better, you are constantly weakened by the suffering, the suffering that doesn't stop, and the strength you need to be a good person and to do the right thing is this world is so hard to find when you are exhausting so much energy just trying to keep yourself and your life from completely disintegrating. it was my fault that the girl made the mistake of deciding that she liked me and that she wanted to care about me, because, of course, i felt the same way about her and selfishly decided to go after it it, and now she has to put up with all the ugliness and insecurity that, deep down, beneath the facade that put up for the people i don't want to hurt, is really there. now she has to tolerate the paranoia and the rages and the narcissism when she deserves so much better, and i have tried to explain this to her, and i have tried to break things off with her a couple of times because it will only hurt her but she won't listen. i can't keep doing this to her, especially in the state that she puts me in, when she gives me the strength to have the empathy i need to really care about someone, which paradoxically makes me feel what she feels so strongly that i am utterly overwhelmed by emotions all the time (she herself suffers from mental health problems, so you can imagine why it would sometimes be hard). now, even since the thing about her former boyfriend deciding to cut her out of his life two weeks ago, she has since emotionally frozen me out, i am becoming worse and worse every day, and i want nothing more than for it to end, nothing more than to stop hurting her, to stop harassing her, and everybody else too, like family, who doesn't deserve to feel bad about my problems either. i understand that there are good qualities about me, things about my personality and the way i am that people like. but in the long term, when they see the real me, how broken i am, what i am truly capable of, it's so devastating, and when it's somebody i care about as much as this girl, i don't know how i could possibly handle it. i can't put her through that. furthermore, because she has so completely changed my life and has been there for me so completely and has made me into a normal person and has really cared in a way that nobody ever has before, i have been become so completely in love with her that i am terrifying myself with the intensity of my love, terrified of how it makes me act and the thoughts i have about her (not sexual necessarily, i should say, which is a completely different story in itself), and i don't want her to be around that either, the unattractive creepiness and profound obsessiveness. i need her to be there to feel normal but i can't possibly see how it's worth it for her, and because i feel such intense empathy for her, to the extent that i feel her emotions more profoundly than perhaps she even feels her own, the thought of her having to put up with that, me compounding her misery like that, puts me in this state of perpetual anxiety with all these horrible physiological symptoms like a feeling of suffocating, a quivering tightness in my stomach, constant crying, trembling hands, etc, etc. i walk around and i feel so incredibly blessed and lucky that this amazing this has happened to me and, yet, at the same time so scared for her because of the person i know that i am and just how bad i know myself to be. these past couple of weeks have not only reminded me of what i'm like when she is not around, but also the fact that nothing can ever come of this relationship and that things will inevitably go back to the way they were before, something we knew from the beginning, because it's only on the internet, and we could never meet up in real life because she doesn't like me nearly as much as i like her. she thinks i'm joking when i say this, but the idea of living with her and getting married and raising kids is perhaps the first actually pleasant future i have ever realistically imagined for myself. the fact that it will never happen, and the fact that such thoughts are insane, creepy and inappropriate just makes it worse. she wants to be a friend because i suppose she likes certain things about me i guess, and yet i am struggling so hard to repress these feelings that are more intense than i could have ever possibly imagined, feelings i didn't know could even be felt, an intensity of emotion i didn't think was possible in anyone. i had hope for a very short while early on in the relationship because i genuinely thought something might come of it, especially considering that she would entertain my silly asides about getting married and having kids, and the discussions we would have about what to name them. and how many boys and girls we would have, and it was wonderful, and for the first time in my life, it gave me hope. late at night, she would send me messages on twitter saying she wished she was there with me in bed with, cuddling and watching tv, something so sweet and kind and from which she expected nothing in return. such relationships are not completely off the table for me as long as it's not with her, and i could have these things if i wanted, considering that i know of at least four people who have crushes on me, but the simple fact is, they are not her, and when i think of my future with them and then compare that to my future with her, i would be going through the motions instead of committing to this completely extraordinary things that i would spend the rest of my life in utter disbelief over, this idea that somebody so special and magical would come along and actually want to be with me for no reason other than the fact that i am me (certainly wasn't going to do it for the money or anything, because i don't have much going for me aside from personality and maybe looks, to some extent). the fact is, there cannot possibly be another girl (or guy) like this anywhere in the world because she is completely, utterly unique, not just in the sense that people are all distinct from each other, but in the sense that everybody else i have ever met is only a fraction of what she is, only ticking a few boxes while she nails every one, acing the quiz with flying colors. the way i see it is, the girls i've been interested in before, the reason i've liked them is because they were ten percent of what this girl is, whereas the real thing is obviously one hundred percent. the problem is that there is no future there because, as i have mentioned, she doesn't feel the same way about me as i do about her, and there is no financially tenable way for us to actually meet even if she did, and finally, because i am such a completely broken, crazy, insecure person, having a relationship with somebody like me when there are so many guys who would be much more capable of being there for her would always haunt me. what has happened is that i had a brief window of hope and now that i'm realizing it was a fleeting thing, i'm not sure how i'm going to go back to how it was. i have given up on my dream of making music and writing, as perhaps i should have done a long time ago, and i have deleted my various profile pages and websites which featured my stories and songs. i can't even entertain the possibility of dating because i was always holding out for somebody like this girl and now that i know for certain that there is someone out there like that, the idea of settling is not only difficult to accept, but literally untenable. furthermore, now that i know how much it people can hurt you once you open up your heart to them, i think i would be too afraid to ever do it again. we used to speak all time on various social media sites and i have erased my profiles from there too, because it's like smoking, i would rather quit completely than try to cut down, or, to abandon the metaphor entirely, i would rather not be with her at all than care about her so fucking much and love her so fucking much when she only thinks of me as a friend. of course, i know this is selfish, because i believe that she does need someone to provide companionship to her, and to be there for her unconditionally, and to support her in the ways that needs to be supported, but i have really tried to do that without bringing all of my complicated, creepy emotional shit into it and i just can't do it. i am just not strong enough which, again, is something i told her from the beginning, but like the other stuff, she just didn't want to be believe it for some reason, though perhaps her recent coldness means she finally is. it was better before, because i didn't know what it was like to have someone that i could love and trust completely, and it's like they say, ignorance is bliss. the problem now, really, is the hopelessness. i didn't write this necessarily because i was looking for advice, though please feel free to provide it if you would like, it more just that i needed to get this out of my system so that i wouldn't have it spinning around in my head keeping me up night after night in the future, though that will likely still happen anyway. it's one thing to have the hopelessness that comes along with depression, something that i have carried with me my entire life and which has prevented me from pursuing any kind of career or committing to any kind of long term goals, basically totally fucking up my future and making it impossible for me to live anything resembling a conventional life, but to then have that moment of hope, to actually be excited to get a job for once and to sustain a career and raise a family and have a reason to try to be good -- i mean, to want to give everything you can to support people you love and make things as easy for them as possible, and to then have that snatched away, that is incredibly numbing, so different to the emotional intensity of what we had, the rollercoaster feeling of following her through the high highs and the low lows. this has been an extremely long post, but hopefully i've been able to explain everything and articulate exactly why this feeling of hopelessness has returned, the fact that there will be no future as such, that i will never be normal like i thought i was going to be, that i would never spend my life with the most beautiful, extraordinary woman in the world like she was really convincing me we would earlier on. don't worry about suicide or anything because i am far too afraid to go through with it, but yeah, from here on out, it's going to be incredibly hard, and as much as i was grateful for what it was while it lasted, in a way, i would have preferred to not have been teased like that, to not know what it's like to be normal, because it was so good, and i will miss it so much, and it will be a very long time until i open up my heart like this again and allow myself to have hope even though it will inevitably be crushed, if ever.",depression,3

(yes... i left only for this reason). not my wisest choices... but hey, i was a young mistake 2: being overconfident.. i knew it would be a disaster if i got caught... but that didn't stop me from flaunting coz i was a proud murtaad....(xd). so in my stupidity i let my cousin know that i stopped believing (we were both stoned) mistake 3: trusting the wrong person..after knowing that i was exmoose, my (haafiz stoner) cousin along with my extended family lured me to a bar and caught me there...stupid i know!but i trusted the dude unfortunately... things got really ugly after that... family intervention, less talking, more beating... finally a bakra (sacrificial goat) to realise their violent fantasies... mom tried to stop em, they said it was all her fault... dad was just shocked...couldn't do much the beatings didn't break me... the words did... as i slowly crawled my way to get some water , my aunt spilled it and said ""don't touch the water, your unholy touch will taint it, and we won't be able to drink it"". still makes me sick to this day. i finally knew what it meant to be untouchable. my concussed head could only think of suicide at the time ... so when everyone else was praying grabbed some essentials, 30 bucks and a swiss knife (coz if anyone came after me i'd kill them and then i would've killed myself)... they stopped me before i could leave... then they locked me in the balcony (my home for the next week) consequently... i had to drop out of college, they'd decided i would be going away to a madrassa for 6 months... my life was over, i knew i was never going to recover from this... so the night before i was supposed to leave for the madrassa i decided to run away, to either kill myself in peace or try my luck on the streets.. but this would probably be my only good decision, the reason i'm posting this right now... i decided against running away or commiting suicide. i thought i was a coward for not finding the courage to commit suicide, but it would take only a moment of courage to kill myself... but i would need courage for a lifetime if i were to live... i realised that this was my only shot at life and even if ending it would mean peace, i wanted to see if i could weather the storm and eventually do what i want to do and live a happy life. if it got too dark,this is my redemption arc: so the next morning, they found my stuff at the door and realised i was gonna run away... used that to somehow get through to my parents and didn't have to go away, but instead attend madrassa near my place where i could come home everyday the next four months of madrassa were hell... but the teacher at the place was a great guy... he was willing to listen to my problems and even debate with me.. of course i didn't buy his justification but atleast it we had civilized conversation. got out early from madrassa for good behaviour,got myself a job, did well, got a promotion to another city but parents didn't let me (family pressure).parents agreed to send me back to college but it was late in the semester... so lost 2 years of college if your wondering what happened to my backstabbing hafiz stoner cousin, karma got him, they found out about his colourful behaviour and things got bad for him. things are quite good now... my relationship with my parents is better than before, i'm doing well professionally (until i get back to college). ghosted the extended family, convinced parents how toxic they actually were. this phase would be the middle of my progress montage... i've not exactly made it in life... but i'm getting there, so i'm hopeful these would be the lessons i learnt from my experiences: 1. don't be overconfident and think it's okay to come out of the closet unless you have a backup plan 2. be extra careful who you trust, even your brother (not all) can betray you if they've got something to gain 3. carefully plan all your moves 4. try to gain financial independence as soon as possible and don't try coming out otherwise 5. don't let bad things define who you are, hardship reveals character 6. never lose hope, it all works out itself if you want it 7. time heals, things do get better 8. forgive but never forget 9. patience is your best friend if you've come this far, thank you for reading. just wanted to get things off my chest, hopefully you get to learn something from this. and if you're struggling right now, hang on...things get better only if you believe in yourself. i cant claim that others haven't suffered worse than me... but if i can try coming out of it, so can you good luck if you'd like to read a more detailed version, the links are in the comment section : [part [part [part",none,5

1695928e-cf6f-45d6-a2de-f114a4b96094,"context – yesterday in a thread i happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a tl;dr of the book once i am finished. on the onset if you have the time and resources, i would highly recommend reading the book. it’s published by juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at rs. 80. i have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. this is one of few good biographies i have read, partly due to the caravan magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author’s perceptions and also because the subject (baba ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. it took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. the author – priyanka pathak narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for mint and that is where she begins on this journey. as part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including balakrishna – ramdev’s deputy and owner of 94% of shares of patanjali ayurveda ltd. so here we go * baba ramdev (ram kisan yadav) was born in said alipur in a poor farming family. a sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father’s frequent violent outbursts. * somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of arya samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. he joined khanpur gurukul where he learnt sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be acharya balakrishna * balakrishna is quite into ayurveda and is from haridwar where he befriends **acharya karamveer** – a stoic, soft spoken arya samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in yoga, indian philosophy and vedas. karamveer soon takes balakrishna under his wing and soon ramdev joins them after a controversy. * ramdev learns yoga from karamveer. to propagate yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **shankar dev**, a patron of kripalu bagh ashram at haridwar. shankar dev wants and only trusts karamveer. but since he is arya samaj member he is not just ready to take sanyas. sensing an opportunity, ramdev steps in. taking sanyas means two things - 1) he can’t keep any formal relations with his family 2) he cannot maintain any material wealth. i am bringing this up of course because this is very important * balakrishna meanwhile sets up divya pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, swami yogananda. balakrishna himself from **nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport. * in early 2000s, aastha and sanskar become household name. the tv guys select ramdev over karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **an interesting story here is that after aastha turned ramdev down, our diligent baba went to sanskar paying rs 1 lakh for a twenty minute slot.** this is also where i learnt that channels like sanskar and aastha don’t earn from advertising but godmen paying them for tv slots to demonstrate their abilities * we all now know the story. ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship * soon ramdev has friends at high places. **mulayam singh, nd tiwari from congress, sudarshan agarwal – ex up governor.** so when they are charged with sales tax fraud, sudarshan agarwal mounts immense pressure on sales tax deputy commissioner to drop the case and retire. * ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. his younger brother ram bharat is soon in charge of the finances. this causes rift between karamveer and ramdev. afterall ramdev shouldn’t have familial relations. so one day, karamveer just walks out. * swami yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of divya pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** the neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. * enter rajeev dixit. a swadeshi and founder of azadi bachao andolan. ramdev’s interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of balakrishna and ram bharat * meanwhile, his political favors with the congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of food processing plants. but soon, due to not paying workers at divya pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of citu. brinda karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‘testicles of some sort of wildcat’. apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the union health ministries’ ayurvedic unit – ayush confirmed traces of human and animal dna. karat apparently met n.d tiwari but according to her the minister didn’t budge to take any action * soon ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. patanjali ayurved ltd is born over the controversial divya pharmacy. and here we see the next mystery. the disappearance of 77 year old tb infested shankar mahadev (ramdev’s guru). mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of ramdev and his deputies. police find nothing but a note in his room saying “i have taken some loan from you for this trust but i cannot pay it. please forgive me. i am leaving”. ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn’t cut it short as would have been expected. * ramdev and rajeev dixit set up a new party – **bharat swabhiman andolan.** * the takeover of aastha – when sebi freezes 93% of aastha’s owners share, sensing an opportunity ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. the installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to ramdev. part of this was done in faith. once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, ramdev bullies the owner and md into resignation. meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy sanskar channel for him. which that follower did. * as mentioned earlier, keeping inline with ramdev’s political ambitions, rajeev dixit and ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of balakrishna and ram bharat. soon, rajeev dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. the hospital said it was cardiac arrest. ramdev said on television that he had told rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, bp and heart disease. but rajeev’s brother pradeep says that he had no such health problems. next, ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in haridwar as dixit was son of the soil instead of his native wardha. but as his body was laid for public demonstration, the bharat swabhiman andolan workers were stunned. dixit’s face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. his skin was peeling strangely. there was black, blue blood coming from his nose. soon there was hue and cry. the andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **hindu dharma.** when they refused to budge, ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‘some people have come from mumbai. they want me to do a post mortem. such cutting is against hindu dharma’. soon ramdev’s men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats. * ramdev’s biggest fall came during his participation in the anna movement. he wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger lokpal bill, ramdev was more about bringing black money back. so he sat on a fast onto death protest. meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior congress members (pranab mukerjee, p.k bansal, kapil sibal and subodh kant sahay). he then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. this ired the congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez** * part of the credit towards the success of patanjali should go to their ex-ceo – **s.k patra**. he helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on ramdev’s business enterprises by the congress govt. but soon patra’s influence once again made balakrishna and ram bharat uneasy. patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with baba. * today patanjali is the second largest fmcg company with revenue of **rs 10561 crores**. its best selling products are ghee – **rs 1467 crore**, dant kanti toothpaste – rs 940 crore. but patanjali ghee isn’t normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - * part of the reason for patanjali’s market share is its price. its below market as baba believes only in taking a marginal share. but this is also possible because working at patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. economic times has published a transcript from the book on this section – * there are a number of violations flagged by fssai (food safety and standards authority of india) including license number fraudulence on patanjali noodles. a lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units. ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. he has no doubt helped popularize yoga and ayurveda in india. the people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. his close association with bjp government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. his target is to get patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. and under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. finally, i realise that the tl;dr post itself needs a tl;dr. but its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. hence once again would recommend reading the book. edit 1: formatting edit 2: woah! thanks for the gold kind stranger. though i would rather have people reading the book. while indian non fiction writing and publishing are much to be desired, ventures like these must be encouraged. that will allow us to see similar good books that talk about interesting men, policies, events etc.",none,5

[check out spirit's route map to get a feel of where you might want to fly. **how to get a good deal:** sign up for their specials email. [linkage at least twice a week they typically have a 48 hour sale. typically a monday-tuesday and a thursday-friday sale. you don't have to sign up for the email though, you can just visit [this on their website to see what deals are being offered. note: most of the cheapest fares are on tues/wed, but i've had good success getting flights on fri/sat/mon. **$36 off each roundtrip:** i was intrigued by spirit's website saying ""lower fares generally available at the airport"". i'm at my local airport quite a bit, so i started asking them to price out some tickets and compared the prices to their website. i found out that every flight you take is $17.99 cheaper per one way/$35.98 per roundtrip when purchased at the counter. you can book months in advance, but the specials are typically only in the next 21-60 days. you don't have to ask for any special discount, it just prices out this way. additional note: make sure you find out when your local spirit counter is open as you can't buy airfare at their kiosks. the desks are typically open between 120 minutes and 30 minutes before a flight. **getting around expensive baggage fees:** unfortunately, the real answer is that you can't really. but, you can take full advantage of their free personal item size of 16"" x 14"" x 12"". you can get a surprisingly large amount of stuff in a bag that size. a few companies have started making bags that size and you can search ebay for a 'personal item' sized airline bag. ciao makes a bag that sells at costco for as little as $30. lots of times the check-in agents don't monitor closely and you can get away with a bigger bag, but if they catch you it's $100. if you are looking at a weekend getaway, there is no reason to pay spirit for any baggage fees! an ""advanced"" tactic is getting a jacket with lots of pockets, which aren't subject to being sized. i have a scottevest jacket that has 26 pockets and while i haven't used it to bring extra clothing with me, i can definitely say it is worth the nearly $200. **travel thousands of miles for $15** if you took a look at the deals page you saw that even without the $9 fare club (which is really unnecessary), you can get tickets as little as $34 one way. $34, minus the $18 you can save by booking at the airport means that you pay under $16 for a flight. i have no idea if the $9 fare club airfare prices out cheaper at the airport. would love to hear if that is the case. denver to atlantic city is 1,597 miles each way and you can fly it for $30 round trip. **examples of flights available *right now* for $15 one-way (available in reverse as well):** * atlantic city to atlanta, boston, chicago, or detroit * baltimore to dallas or myrtle beach * charleston, wv to myrtle beach * chicago to dallas, kansas city, pittsburgh, minneapolis, myrtle beach, or new orleans * dallas to denver, kansas city, or new orleans * and so on, and so on. [check em all out even if it isn't $15, it could be $25 or $30 each way which is still a smoking bargain. **other spirit pro-tips:** 1) **if you can afford it, purchase the ""big front seat""**. spirit only charges about $30-$35 one way for the bigger seat. it's basically a real first class seat and it is worth every penny if you have a long flight. [found a pic online of some of the older seats. as you can see, much much 2) don't expect anything on the flight. drinks/food is expensive, but it is available. not even if you buy the big front seat. 3) the legroom sucks. it's really tight. if you are 6' or taller then you should consider purchasing extra leg room seating. **what can go wrong when flying spirit and how to protect yourself** spirit typically only flies once a day (or less, maybe 3 or 4 times/week) to each destination. if they have to cancel their flight for some reason, then you can get boned. in the event of a major problem, their customer service is basically worthless and will certainly be swamped. you can protect yourself by purchasing your ticket with a credit card that offers free travel insurance. lots of cards exists that provide help if you need to book a hotel and can even pay for it (one of my cards provides $500/year in coverage). spirit also can lose your bag. again, book with a credit card that offers lost baggage insurance and enjoy some new clothes/makeup. while i haven't experienced any yet, you could also run into some nasty delays. i wouldn't count on spirit (or any airline) to get me there if i had to be somewhere within a few hours of landing. **edit: forgot frequent flier miles!** spirit will give you 8,000 frequent flier miles for free and one-way flights start at only 10,000 miles if within 1,250 miles. [get all of the redemption options here (pdf **the miles expire in 3 months if you don't have any account activity** you can earn spirit miles without flying (by buying things on the internet via their shopping portal). there is way more flexibility using award miles versus trying to nab $15 flights, so if you love the miles game, then spirit can be rewarding. this could be it's own whole post though. happy to answer any questions below. **tldr:** spirit has big sales, so look at their deal page. buy your ticket at the airport to save $36 per roundtrip. you get a free 16""x14""x12"" personal item, so maximize your use of the free bag. buy your ticket with a credit card that offers free travel insurance.",none,5

3c98f09c-7bc2-47d3-b95c-3787c2076dfc,"i typically use unbiased or progressive sources for my news and politics, so for one week i decided to limit myself to conservative shows on fox and websites like the drudgereport. i had of course seen clips from fox shows and even caught an episode or two years ago but i hadn't sat down for multiple episodes in a row like a true fan. my thesis going into my little experiment was that i would find that the conservative sources were more accurate and less cartoonishly biased and ridiculous than how they were portrayed in my typical news sources. my experience surprised me: * **the facade of debate:** if i only watched shows like the five, the o'reilly factor and america live with megyn kelly i would think that progressives were all weak, dim, unable to argue even basic issues, and that they didn't believe in their overly convoluted (read: not common sense) rationalizations. [the is a show with five hosts, where 2 co-alpha males and 2 attractive females belittle an overweight, gray haired buffoon who throws out half arguments then defeatedly nods and exhales as the confident and dismissive conservatives set him straight. on one episode of the o'reilly factor, they had a segment on the health care birth control controversy and they brought on a small time radio radio host who would make half a point, get cut off and mocked in a dismissive manner (pattern!) by o'reilly then giggle and acquiesce. in o'reilly's other segments, geraldo rivera and bernard goldberg, the latter a conservative and the former a fox reporter and dullard, would again half-heartedly make one or two ""progressive"" arguments then be set straight by o'reilly. * **the online echo chamber, or how to self-censor the greatest tool for communication and information since the printing press:** so the cbo released a new budget projection for obama's health care plan over 9 years, the big (true) story was that the new projection was [billions less than a previous and if you searched for articles from non-partisan sources that's exactly what you learned. however when i did a search for ""cbo cost health care legislation"" over the first 24 hrs, [i got a very different for me, the very first result was a [washington examiner where the journalist proclaims that the cbo budget shows a 1.76 trillion dollar cost to obamacare, which he says is nearly double obama's original claim of around 900 billion. the problem here is that his cost is a **gross** cost- it doesn't take into account offsetting revenue and spending reductions which would bring the cost down to ~1 trillion which is what the non partisan sources are reporting. seems like a clearly, egregiously misleading statement on the reporter's part and surely one that would be quickly rebutted by other sources telling the truth. the problem is that if you went to any conservative site over the first 24 hrs, literally every single site referred to the washington examiner article alone and made the same claim, that obama lied about the costs by nearly 100%. if you remember the recent study that showed that [fox news viewers are actually less informed than people who don't watch news at you can now see exactly how this happens. finally- * **talking points as journalism:** prior to my week of conservative media i saw a [daily show about a conservative talking points memo that fox news's steve doocy erroneously read on the air. indeed, the most striking part of my experience was how consistently the same set of talking points were made across all conservative media. on every show and every website the same ""common sense"" conclusions were made by both ""opinion"" pundits like o'reilly and supposedly objective fox reporters: a) gas prices were not only controllable by the president but the current price was the result of his energy policy (not the shutting down of refineries on the east coast, not the massive consumption growth by the worlds two most populous countries china and india, and not iran's blockade of the strait of hormuz-&gt; a situation that is conveniently being exacerbated by us conservatives' saber rattling), b) obama lied about health care costs by 100% as i explained earlier, and c) bill maher's use of the word cunt in describing palin was equivalent to limbaugh calling sandra fluke a slut and obama was hypocritical to not return maher's donation. i heard these same points hammered into my head over and over again, without any sort of nuance or debate. even if your media consumption included non-partisan sources, it would be incredibly challenging to not buy into the only arguments being set forth by every conservative news source that you at least respected enough to consume. if you believe that fox's reportage is compartmentalized from its pundit echo chamber, as they claim, then you have no chance whatsoever. the day after the cbo budget was released, every supposedly unbiased fox reporter's focus was on the 900 billion to 1.76 trillion dollar gap or on gas prices and the president's early refusal of the keystone oil pipeline. in conclusion, if you're like me and you avoided conservative news sources like the plague not because they were conservative but because you suspected the reportage was terrible, you were right. and if you feel comfortable in obama's chances for reelection, mostly because of poor competition, don't underestimate just how misinformed conservatives and right leaning independents may be. **edit:** i avoided adding an edit for awhile because the ""thank you speech"" edits drive me fucking crazy, but i do want to give a few blanket answers to the literally hundreds of direct questions i've gotten: * yes i'm aware that there is no truly, purely, unbiased source but i thought that was so obvious i didn't need to say it- apparently not... i'm a naturally skeptical person so even though i consider npr, bbc, pbs, nyt, reuters and al jazeera to be as close to unbiased as there is, i'm always wary of being sold to, and i watch for the sin of omission in their reportage. * yes i watched the supposedly unbiased reporters on fox news, i even emphasized this point in my write-up, but i guess people didn't read the whole thing. it's important to reiterate because this is basically how fox tricks you, as [david frum they convince you that every non-conservative source is biased and that only they are telling the truth. but as i showed in my cbo budget example, this is demonstrably untrue. * i absolutely, honestly went into this experiment thinking that some of my preconceptions would be proven untrue, and it truly made me nervous- no one likes that initial feeling of having deeply held beliefs shaken, it's very unsettling. but the truth was worse than i expected, fox tv is almost a parody of a propaganda machine and if you don't believe it try the experiment yourself, it doesn't take much investment to change channels and unsubscribe from [/r/politics](/r/politics). * many have asked me to do a similar version with the liberal media, but i already consume liberal media along with my non-partisan sources and you do too if you come to [/r/politics](/r/politics). the fact is, from my experience, when i learn something from a liberal source such as [/r/politics](/r/politics), huffingtonpost, the daily show/colbert, politico (may be considered neutral) and then i read the unbiased and the occassional conservative source, that ""liberal"" information is rarely contradicted by reality. when i took in conservative rhetoric i would often a) immediately know something was incorrect because of for instance my education in business and economics, b) find out later it was factually incorrect such as in the cbo example, or c) recognize the logical fallacy in their arguments- if anything proved the lack of sophistication of their audience, it was that they would tolerate such terrible argumentation. if you looked at my link to the study about how[ informed particular viewers you can see that even comedic satire from the daily show gets you closer to the facts than so-called news from fox. * finally, i just wanted to say that i will now continue to consume conservative sources (i have drudge as a favorite) because i learned that it gives me direct access to republicans' game plan, and because it's always good to hear counter arguments even if they're not always intellectually honest.",none,5

3412dad1-a520-47b4-8d97-4da84de789bd,"based on questions that come up time and time again here is my faq, opinions and recommendation on a whole load of places in switzerland. this is not an absolute guide, but one based on what i have done and seen. it has slowly been put together as thoughts come to mind, and i will probably slowly edit it as other things come up. i am from the uk and am lucky enough to have been living in switzerland for a year and a half now for work. i have been travelling as much as possible all over the country [(very rough whilst i can, and i have seen more of the country than most of my swiss coworkers. i like to try and push the lesser-known spots: just going by the posts you see on reddit you would think the country only consisted of 3 or 4 places. i am a bit overly cynical at times with some places, but that doesn’t mean i don’t like them (and there are plenty of other posts raving about them elsewhere). i have posted a few times before that might be useful: * [a vast load of photos with * [my overview post of travel here in * [my guide to * see [this for information on moving here * see [this for yet more pretty pictures, and my submission history for more pictures still to various other subs. i have become somewhat obsessed with switzerland since i moved here for a number of reasons: * as is well know, the country is rather beautiful and easy to get around. it is also about as safe and friendly (in its own way) place as you can get. * having the time and (especially) money whilst being in the country is obviously a pretty big motivator. the prices are painful, they were especially painful at first when i converted everything back to pounds. * it is tiny, but there is so much of it. so many different landscapes and cultures. no other country has such a density of interesting things. glaciers, rustic alpine villages, and bright mediterranean style towns are only a short distance apart. * it its country of opposites. conservative yet liberal. quiet and withdrawn, yet social and loud. famous for being neutral and peaceful yet filled with military defences and installations…. **bonus point: we have snakes! venomous snakes too! and they can live up to 2000m up! i have almost stood on one near a glacier.** quick fire points: * [there are lots of useful internet-resources for getting around, figuring out what to do, and * **no town is so big that you need to spend days there, other than as a base to go elsewhere.** even the biggest cities can be basically done in a few hours (unless you really love museums and architecture). the ability to easily and quickly flow from city, to county, to mountain, and back again is what really makes it wonderful here. use a city for day trips out, then move on to another spot. the trick is to keep hopping around every few days. though not too fast: spending 2 or 3 days purely sat on trains to get to, go on the glacier express, and then back out of the country again is just absurd. * getting by with just english will be very easy in the main international tourist spots and on trains. elsewhere it can be a bit more hit and miss, though the swiss are very tolerant and will try to help there as best they can. any efforts to at least attempt a “bonjour” or “sprechen sie englisch?” will be much more appreciated than just diving in with english like it was the national language. [in most places the local language should be fairly if in doubt check what is written on signs or adverts (biel/bienne is the only place which is truly bilingual). also the number of people who speak two or more swiss languages with perfect fluency is much smaller than you might expect - so don’t expect french to work for you in appenzell. even along the french/german language border many people only speak one or the other. * shops close early. 6:30pm during the week is common, with shorter hours on saturday and most are not open at all on sunday. train-station/airport/petrol-station shops stay open till 10pm everyday. the opening hours also applies to things like dentists, if you are going to have an emergency try and do it early on a weekday (and with a few days written notice). * switzerland is not exactly cheap. it will hurt your wallet. if you are careful you can minimise the damage somewhat, but it is still much more expensive than its bigger neighbours. on the plus side everything is high quality at least. * paying for small items with a 100chf banknote is perfectly normal and will not offend shopkeepers (unlike when you pull out a twenty in the uk….). * transport is fairly expensive, but will get you literally anywhere in a reasonable amount of time. [look into sbb travel passes if you are going to move about the sbb phone app lets you buy discount tickets at non-peak times fixing you to a certain train but saving you up to 50%; combine this with the half-tax train pass for 75% reductions on train tickets. passes also apply either fully or partially to most boats and cable-cars, so are very useful to have. * accommodation is expensive. even the cheapest dorm rooms will set you back 25chf and up to 50chf is not uncommon (though all the yha hostels are very good quality and come with a good breakfast at least). figure 40chf per person as the very cheapest rate for hotel rooms (possibly with breakfast costing 10chf or more). double beds can mean two single beds, or a single frame with two mattresses and a giant hole - rarely does it actually mean a proper double bed. camping seems to start from 10chf per tent and 10chf per person. wild camping is not legal as such, as far as i know, though if you are not stupid, leave no mess, and do it in remote places nobody will probably know or mind (and ask the local farmer if possible to be polite). * food can be reasonable. eating out is expensive, but eating basic and/or supermarket foods will keep the price down quite a bit. as low as 10chf per day is probably doable if you really like bread and cheese (the bread and cheese here is rather good!). take-away food like kebabs start at ~10chf, and restaurant mains are ~15chf upwards in cheap places. traditional swiss foods like rösti or spätzli tend to be quite cheap. i tend to just pick a restaurant by a mix of price, type of food, and how nice the place looks - . * do not underestimate the sun in the mountains! little shade and thin-air are a dangerous combination for sunburn at any time of year. i thought that having just spent 6 months in queensland i would be immune to the sun, returning to work on monday my colleagues were delighted by the red-faced “typisch engländer!” in their midst. * walk for at least a few hours in a high meadow. it doesn’t have to be anything hard, but get out away from the villages and transport stations for at least a little bit to really appreciate the landscape. * if you are driving through make sure you have a swiss road-tax badge for the car after you enter the country, otherwise you might get a hefty fine. seasons: * weather – with both sides of the alps and jura mountains and so many valleys there is (almost) always somewhere nice in switzerland if you are prepared to travel a little. * may is a wonderful time with picture-perfect wildflower filled green valleys and snowy peaks. though it is off season in many places so access to high peaks and passes can be limited. * those perfect clear summer views you see in photos are a sadly rare sight. haze from the heat can really limit the view. my local mountain in the juras has a great view of the entire alpine range in winter, but you are lucky to see the closest peaks in summer. still beautiful, but be prepared to not see as far as you might hope. * be like a true swiss person and swim in the summer. lakes, rivers, pools are all good. just be careful as some places can be dangerous - check what the locals are doing first. * summer is a very lively time of year with festivals of every type all over the country. including the unfortunately named “blue balls” in luzern (still not sure if they named it that way on purpose or not). * autumn brings beautiful golden larch trees and possibly some snow in the mountains. the south ridge of the jura and places like napf are wonderful during this time: [colourful trees, and fantastic panoramas of the alps rising above the autumn mists * october-february can be very misty in the flatland due to temperature inversion. [you get sunshine, clear views, and a beautiful sea of cloud from above, but only grey fog down it varies place to place how bad it is (i live in solothurn where it is really bad by the aare). * in recent years there has been one or two short bursts of snow but otherwise nothing before the end of december. great for late hiking, less good if you fancy a festive ski session. * in the snowy months resorts have prepared walking/sledging paths for those who want to take in the mountains but (like me) don’t ski. sledges can be rented and the mountain routes are great fun (remember use a foot flat on the ground to turn). **part 1. the eternal bloody question: “luzern, zurich, interlaken, or jungfrau region (etc)?”** basically the cliché switzerland travel question “i have 2-3 days, which of these should i go to?” in short: all are very touristy, and if you have no experience in this country you will probably love any and all of them. this is a rather cynical review, i do like them (mostly), but there are plenty enough posts already out there raving about them all. in shorter: they are good (though i like other places in the country more), other than zürich and geneva which are best just used as airports. **jungfrau region** the photogenic tourist heartland, and what most people seem to mean when they think of switzerland. i can understand the hype; i was blown away when i first came here. but having travelled far and wide it has sunk down in my list of top places, and most swiss people that i talk to don’t rate it in their top places either. it is still one of my convenient go to places, i just wish other places got more attention. grindelwald, wengen and mürren are in a sense all very much the same - chalet filled tourist villages (with a mini supermarket in each) that offer fantastic views, and offer easy access to high wildflower filled meadows, walking paths, and cable cars, or winter sports depending on the season. grindelwald is the biggest and has by far the most shopping/dining options. mürren limits you a bit by being more out of the way and slower to get to/from. wengen has impressive views up the valley. lauterbrunnen village is the least pleasant and has the worst views (but a damn good coffee shop). generally speaking if you don’t know anything about the region, then just picking any of them at random should make you happy. * kleine scheidegg is the obvious go to. seeing the ionic eiger, mönch, jungfrau trio right in front of you is incredible, though i find that they are best seen from further away to really appreciate their size. i highly recommend walking at least as far as the eiger gletscher stop to take in the area and not just do it all by train. the area is however littered with vast amounts of skiing infrastructure which ruins it a bit for me. * jungfraujoch. the serious showpiece of the region. the highest train station in europe (not the highest point or highest mountain). expensive but amazing. [stepping out of the underground station and seeing this is utterly just make sure the weather is good or you will be paying 180chf each to see some cloud. if possible do not buy tickets until the last minute and go early or late in the day when it will be clearer and there will be less (relatively anyway) people – though be warned in the busiest days of summer i think it can sell out. the ride up stops at the eiger north face and glacier windows giving you plenty of time to jump out and take a look, most people are reluctant to leave at first so jump out quick to get the view to yourself for a minute. the inside has a few novelty walks and gift shops but generally isn’t very interesting. take waterproof shoes and walk along the prepared path from the observatory building along the path in the snow to monachjoch hut. takes 30(?) minutes each way and it is great to be out in the snow and mountains, and is fairly quiet as most people stay at the main building. but do remember that jungfraujoch is not the be all and end all of switzerland (honestly i think there are many places with better views and more to do high up), so if you miss out it doesn’t mean a ruined trip. * männlichen offers possibly the best viewing point in the area from the strangely themed [royal walkway]( a full view of the northern faces of the jungfrau region and beyond, looking down onto grindelwald and all the way up lauterbrunnen valley, and down to interlaken, thunnersee and the flatland and jura beyond. cable cars go up from grindelwald and wengen. you can walk along from kleine scheidegg without too much change in height (or walk from anywhere if you have the time and energy because this is switzerland). * lauterbrunnen valley is utterly stunning. walk from lauterbrunnen itself to at least the trummelbach falls to appreciate it from within. the trummelbach falls are well worth the entry price, though remember the temperature inside is cold even on the hottest day in summer. * lauterbrunnen village i find odd and not that nice. it was a bit of a let-down to me does not feel like you imagine it should from photos that make it look so nice. it is more like a transport hub and most people clear out upwards right away. i have yet to see the main street lively in any way. it is also home to big carparks and a campsite which detract from it quite a bit. the staubbachfall waterfall is a quick 5 or so minute walk from the station and you can go up inside the cliff at its base. given the lack of light i would really recommend not staying there. * mürren (murren means to grumble, not that anyone is going to care). you would think heaven crashed into shangri la from the way the internet goes on about this place. certainly it is in an impressive location. but you are limited to only a few local options without having to faff about with multiple cable-car and transport methods, great for a few nights but don’t go planning to spend a week there. **interlaken** the best thing about interlaken is it a convenient base and very good transport hub giving plenty of options of where to go: jungfrau region, brienz, kandersteg, bern and many other places are an hour or less away by train from interlaken ost. however the town itself is mostly pretty modern and forgettable. hotels and tourist shops are about all there is. there are nice views, but there are nicer views in much nicer places. * it has no real focus point or style, just feels like a slightly sprawling mess. it is between two lakes, but not on either, which takes away quite a bit of potential charm. queenstown in nz is the obvious place to compare it to in many ways, but queenstown is so much nicer. * the unterseen section near the west station is the nicest area with a tree lined quiet river and old buildings. sitting with my feet in the river on a hot summer evening looking up at jungfrau from there was rather nice. but otherwise i spent one evening there once and now just pass through. * it is very busy and the yha next to the ost station is often constantly booked out in busy season. i stayed in the alplodge hostel which was cheap and had a nice rooftop sitting area. though now i just go straight to the grindelwald yha if i am staying around there overnight. **luzern (lucerne)** one of the main spots and certainly worth a visit. always busy with tourists. the old town has nice parts, but is very given over to tourism and is not the best switzerland has to offer. it does occupy a stunning location and have lots of options for day trips though. * the walls at the back of the old town are impressive, quiet and free to climb up, especially from the tower closest to the river. the smaller wooden bridge further back from the lake is still the original, be sure to look up at the paintings as you go along. the iconic chapel bridge (which partly burnt down and was reconstructed) is generally quiet nice to walk across as the bridges on both sides and the lack of buskers mean that it isn't crowded. * the löwendenkmal (lion monument) is very powerful and surprisingly big. go in the evening or when you are sure it will be quiet, otherwise being surrounded by 4 tour groups will probably ruin it for you somewhat. * during the high-summer season accommodation will be heavily booked, so try and plan going there in advance. * get the train to flüelen and then spend the day riding the boat back along the whole length of the lake (3 hrs) hoping on and off as you like. the far end around flüelen in kanton uri is especially impressive, but most tourists just seem to stay in the gentler luzern end. * rigi and pilatus. both are mountains that stand aside from the alps and offer fantastic views and have multiple transport options to get up. pilatus is probably the more impressive of the two (and a bit less busy too). walking up from wegis to rigi is fairly easy and a very nice hike. **zermatt and the matterhorn** the matterhorn is truly one of the sights that no photo does justice to. no matter how many times you see photos of it, the first thing you say when you see it will be “well bugger me, that's right bloody massive that is!”. it continues to be hypnotically attractive every time you see it. zermatt is pleasant, has a nice atmosphere, and plenty of bars and life, but is not the most interesting place. it is not very authentic either for the most part: the first thing you come across is a mcdonalds. it is surprisingly big, and is mostly just modern chalets. the car-free aspect is nice, though the electric cars can be annoying. note that any electric-car you get into is going to be painfully expensive; so walk if possible. the whole place is expensive really. * take the train to gornergrat and walk up the viewing platform along the ridge (hohtälligrat) to the cable car station or beyond. stunning views, relatively easy going, and fairly quiet. * the edelweissweg going up the pretty trift gorge, along the meadow (you can drop down from here to zermatt), and then looping up and back down a side valley past zmutt is really good - offering almost constant impressive views of the matterhorn once you clear the gorge. **zürich** just not that interesting really. oddly common on people's itineraries; i guess it is the first swiss city that comes to mind and as it is famous people assume it must be good. it isn’t a terrible place, but it just isn’t a very special one either. time and money are precious when travelling in switzerland, and they are better spent elsewhere. * it has a nice enough old town by the lake, with views of the alps. but in the big picture of switzerland it really isn’t very special. if you have been to a moderately nice european city before then there is nothing much of interest here. the famous bahnhofstrasse looks just like any other high-end shopping street in the world (and it isn’t even like the buildings are anything special either). * it does have very good transport connections to most of the country and elsewhere. * it is lively at least. probably more life, night-life, and open shops here than anywhere else in the country. * not the capital city. neither is geneva. it is bern, though the federal government has so little power compared to the kantons that it doesn’t really mean much. **geneva** as above - just not that interesting really. not as nice as zürich either. just don’t bother is my advice. i am sure plenty of people love it, but for me it is just an airport. * geneva does not make the best first impression; you leave the station and have to fight your way through a number of busy and noisy street blocks before you even get to the lake or old town. a busy main road runs along the waterfront around the city centre too (as it does in zurich and luzern too, but it seems so much worse in geneva). * geneva is the only place i have seen in switzerland that really flaunts money with expensive cars everywhere and such like. the country might be wealthy but mostly it is fairly modest. * some nice museums at least. but it is one of the few places in the country that i honestly have felt no desire to go back to. * if i do go back i will check out the rhone-arve river junction which looks like it is worth a look. **the glacier express** 8 hours. 8 hours on a single train. * the route is certainly very pretty, i have covered all of it on normal trains in a number of different stages. you would be hard pressed to find a more consistently stunning route, but by god i do not intend to ever do it in a single day. * i have met people whose entire time in switzerland was spent on trains getting to, from and on the glacier express. that seems downright mental to me. * very few glaciers are actually visible from the route oddly enough. and you pass close, but out of sight, of some of the most amazing ones in the alps (aletsch and morteratsch). * hilariously the windows are shut tight, so (unlike on the standard regional trains) you can’t avoid window reflection in photos. **a few other famous things** **oeschinensee and kandersteg**: the lake really is as striking as it looks in photos. makes for a refreshing swim in summer. because the cliffs are so steep the hiking options are rather limited around it. sunlight is a bit limited too by the cliffs. it turns into a frozen skating ring in the winter with some ski runs nearby. kandersteg itself is a nice village with lots of options for things to do around it. **bern**: the federal capital. very handsome old town that is well worth a few hours to explore by itself. einstein lived here as a young man, but he most certainly did not become instantly inspired by seeing the clocktower as he went past on the bus one day. check out the bear pit in the summer. swimming in the aare is popular in the summer, but it is very fast and dangerous in part so be careful. a very nice atmosphere, but don’t expect lots of night-life. very good transport connections to most of the country so would make a good base. **montreux and château de chillon**: montreux occupies a very beautiful spot, though is not that interesting in itself. a short-train ride, or very nice 30 minute lakeside walk gets you to the château. the château is very impressive, offering quite a bit to see with at least some information on hand in most rooms and possibly also a temporary exhibition. apparently it is also the most visited spot in switzerland, i have been in feburary and had the snowy place to myself. **goldenpass route (montreux-zweisimmen)**: this actually is rather amazing and worth the hype, highly recommended any time of year. been in the various carriages and can’t say the special old-style one made much difference to me. as ever hop on and off and explore the villages and places rather than just seeing them pass by. **interlaken-luzern train**: a very popular route, the luzern end is pretty and the interlaken end very dramatic. doing the brienz-interlaken part by boat is highly recommended. getting off at brünig and walking along the 3hr flat(ish) path to reuti is a good way to take the landscape in properly. meiringen is worth a look for the slightly surreal sight of a town deep in switzerland that is obsessed with sherlock holmes. the reichenbach falls are the infamous spot of the “death” of sherlock holmes, but are not actually that impressive in reality. the aare-gorge is well worth a gander. **gruyères**: a very pretty little village famous for cheese and aliens. the giger museum and bar are well worth seeing, especially for the surreal juxtaposition compared to the village itself. it is in a bit of an awkward spot to get to via public transport from most major places, doable but slower and with more changes than you might expect. best done as a detour along the way rather than a there and back in one day trip. i went on a snowy day in february and it was very beautiful and quiet, though judging by the size of the car parking facilities it must be rammed in summer. **stein am rhein**: i was actually very charmed by this town. not much to it but very nice, especially along the waterfront. the riverside train ride from here to st. gallen is slow but lovely. **swiss national park**: a beautiful area indeed and easy to get into or near with public transport. it really gets sold on the wildlife, but i hardly saw any, less than i have sometimes on other hikes elsewhere in the country. by virtue of being famous and only having limited paths you will have more people around you than you would on paths in places outside of the national park. it feels a bit odd in some ways: it is trying to be wilderness but is so small that you can quickly wander out of it, or see outside of it easily - and it is in a country where the mix of nature and man is one of the best parts. still well worth a visit, but it doesn’t stand out as that special compared to the rest of the country. i rather like the val minger and munt la schera. **rheinfall and schaffhausen**: not overly impressed by the rheinfall. yes a whole load of water is constantly going over. it is surprisingly touristy, the number of boats going back and forth over the water seems almost comical. the tower you can go to is pretty tiny and they seem to put quite a few people on it at a time. also it has an industrial estate opposite the castle which kind of ruins it a bit. schaffhausen itself is a very nice little town, well worth an hour or two to poke around if you are in the area. though unless you are passing by anyway then there isn’t much point going there when you could go the alps instead. **liechtenstein**: “that isn’t switzerland!” i hear you cry. yes, it is another country and being a tiny one is what attracts people’s attention. though it is pretty well integrated into the swiss system (bar the fact it has a prince). it has an interesting history on paper, but in reality the country is pretty dull. unlike switzerland itself it looks like almost everything was built 20 years ago. there are a few impressive looking castles like vaduz and balzers, and the alpine bit is nice enough with the [princes way (fürstensteig) being rather good. but mostly it is a bit bland, and for the high price there are so many more interesting places nearby in switzerland (or cheaper in austria). if it was just another part of kanton st. gallen then hardly anybody would care about it. if you are passing by then stop in for the novelty of a tiny country, but don’t go out of your way for it. **onto more interesting things** **part 2. my top places (in no special order)** [basically see this * **valle verzasca, ticino**. the whole valley and the region around it is just amazingly pretty, it is far more rivendell than lauterbrunnen is to me. the stone rustico villages in this area of the country are especially charming. at the bottom is the contra dam of goldeneye fame, quite funny watching the film after knowing that what is meant to be frozen remote russia is a pretty valley scattered with villages that have palm trees in them. very impressive to look over the edge, though buses are not frequent so it is only worth the stop there with a car. bungy jumping can be arranged. buses go all the way up the valley. but can get full on weekends/holidays. * **the whole of ticino for that matter**. an utterly wonderful region, with fantastic valleys, mountains, and towns. being on the south of the alps it often has sun whilst the north has rain, and the sun lights up the mountains much better. totally overlooked by most travellers so it tends to be fairly quiet (other than the ever present swiss-germans). * **eggishorn and the aletsch glacier, valais**. the aletsch glacier is possibly the single most amazing sight in switzerland. eggishorn gives you a 360 degree view of the alps, and straight down onto the whole of the aletsch glacier. from there you can see the matterhorn, jungfraujoch, and mont blonc among other peaks. a cable car runs up from fiesch. i walked up from fiescheralp cos i am slightly mad, but got rewarded with lots of marmot encounters. then walked down the steep south slope, around the märjelensee and alongside the glacier down to bettmeralp. a long but fantastic walk. you can do shorter and easier walks (or just cable cars). * **saint-ursanne, jura**. a wonderfully charming old town in a rural and pretty (if not dramatic) area. it often appears on swiss tourism images, but because it is so far out of the way not many people get make it out there. * **lavaux vineyard terraces, vaud**. terraced vineyards overlooking lake geneva and the alps. a famous but not very busy area. i recommend going from lutry (with a detour from the station to the shorefront and back to see the village) to st saphorin so you constantly get the mountains as the backdrop. be warned it can be very hot - the paths are south facing, made of stone/cement, and are exposed to reflected sunlight from the lake. * **appenzell and the alpstein**. the whole region feels like the shire collided with tellytubby land. some parts like säntis, seealpsee and gasthaus aescher are quite well known. walking or even just taking public transport anywhere in the area is amazing. renowned for being very traditional, though this is not always a good thing (women couldn’t vote on local matters until the 1990s). * **basically anywhere in graubunden**. the whole kanton is fairly wild and utterly fantastic. not as high or dramatic as the western parts of the country for the most part, but still beautiful. the rumantsch culture and the painted stone house architecture is very unique and interesting. i have yet to see a part which i did not like (well maybe davos….). jumping on and off on the bernina line down to italy is really good, especially walking up to the morteratsch glacier. the area around flims is fairly unknown but rather stunning. just pick anywhere in the kanton and it will be good. st. moritz is not that nice as a town (unless you like expensive flash things), but makes a very good base to get to other places out of. * **bernina express, graubünden**. the whole thing feels like a model-train enthusiast drank too much coffee and got let loose in an engineering workshop. the route is far too good to rush through in a single session. i have spent a few long weekends hopping on and off. trains normally run once an hour so you can jump off and explore somewhere before jumping back on again later. * **centovalli railway, ticino/italy**. a rather unknown line connecting locarno to domodossola. not the most epic but still utterly beautiful mountain scenery. also the fastest way to get from ticino to valais. * **monte tamora, ticino**. not quite 2000m, but the highest peak in the area. providing 360 views of the whole of ticino, the alps, the forested and gentle prealps, the italian lakes, and down to italy. the cable car at rivera puts you an easy 1.5hr walk from the summit itself. there is even a mountain-coaster to keep you entertained. * **lötschental, valais**. a slightly out of the way valley. features everything swiss: little villages, snow capped mountains, a glacier, and cows with bells. it also has masks which are always on show somewhere. * **solothurn**. very pretty, and with almost no tourism it has a very authentic feeling old town. quite lively and full of restaurants given the small size. also has one giant cathedral. * **val de travers, neuchâtel**. one of the best bits in the jura mountains. the aruse gorge, the creux du van, and the upper valley itself are all easy to reach and beautiful to see. * **gasterntal, bern**. a wild valley with only a rough road and a few farmhouses, that ends high up at a glacier. very close to the famous spots of kandersteg and the oschinensee but almost unknown. even transport access is limited with only a rough road and fixed up/down times near the narrow entrance, a taxi-bus runs in the summer requiring booking ahead. the descent down from the gemmi pass is steep but breathtaking. * a summer only village collection of stone houses and even a church. 1.5 hours walk up a cliff from the nearest form of transport. i walked from the station at wasseraun, past seealpsee, up a cliff path to meglisalp, then onto santis (predicted time 5hrs). **part 3. other places** **jura mountains**: somewhat overlooked in favour of the more dramatic alps",,
